    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_p01">In <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch02#averill_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Molecules, Ions, and Chemical Formulas"</a>, you were introduced to the major classes of <em class="emphasis">organic compounds</em>, covalent compounds composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen. Organic substances have been used throughout this text to illustrate the differences between ionic and covalent bonding and to demonstrate the intimate connection between the structures of compounds and their chemical reactivity. You learned, for example, that even though NaOH and alcohols (ROH) both have OH in their formula, NaOH is an ionic compound that dissociates completely in water to produce a basic solution containing Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup> and OH<sup class="superscript">−</sup> ions, whereas alcohols are covalent compounds that do not dissociate in water and instead form neutral aqueous solutions. You also learned that an amine (RNH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), with its lone pairs of electrons, is a base, whereas a carboxylic acid (RCO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>H), with its dissociable proton, is an acid. (For more information on acids and bases, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch02#averill_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Molecules, Ions, and Chemical Formulas"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch02_s05#averill_1.0-ch02_s05">Section 2.5 "Acids and Bases"</a>.)</p>

        <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">The structure of a solid with a hybrid metal-organic framework.</strong> Organic and inorganic groups of the proper structure can be used to synthesize solids with very large pores (central sphere) that can accommodate a variety of small molecules. The rigid benzene rings are used as “props” to hold the metal units (carboxylate-bridged copper dimers) apart. Such solids have potential applications in hydrogen storage for use in fuel cells or automobiles.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_p02">Carbon is unique among the elements in its ability to <em class="emphasis">catenate</em>, to form a wide variety of compounds that contain long chains and/or rings of carbon atoms. (For more information on carbon, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12#averill_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Solids"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12_s08#averill_1.0-ch12_s08">Section 12.8 "Polymeric Solids"</a>, and <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch22#averill_1.0-ch22">Chapter 22 "The "</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch22_s02#averill_1.0-ch22_s02">Section 22.2 "The Elements of Group 14"</a>.) Some of the most complex chemical structures known are those of the organic molecules found in living organisms. (For more information on biopolymers, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12#averill_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Solids"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12_s08#averill_1.0-ch12_s08">Section 12.8 "Polymeric Solids"</a>.) In spite of their size and complexity, these biological molecules obey the same chemical principles as simpler organic molecules. Thus we can use Lewis electron structures to understand the preferred mode of reactivity of a variety of organic compounds, relative electronegativities and bond polarities to predict how certain groups of atoms will react, and molecular orbital theory to explain why certain organic species that contain multiple bonds are especially stable or undergo particular reactions when they interact with light. (For more information on Lewis electron structures, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch08#averill_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Ionic versus Covalent Bonding"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch08_s05#averill_1.0-ch08_s05">Section 8.5 "Lewis Structures and Covalent Bonding"</a>.

In this chapter, we continue our description of organic compounds by focusing on their molecular structures and reactivity; we will also introduce some of the fundamental types of reactions and reaction mechanisms you will encounter in organic and biological chemistry. We discuss why butter is a solid and oils are liquids despite the apparent similarities in their structures, why the widely used anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen takes longer than half an hour to relieve pain, and the identity of the major carcinogen in grilled meats and cigarette smoke. The chapter concludes with a brief introduction to the molecules of life, which will explain how the consumption of lactose can result in mental retardation and cirrhosis of the liver in some individuals, how hibernating animals survive during the winter, and how certain groups of antibiotics kill bacteria that are harmful to humans.</p>

These include alkanes, with the general molecular formula C<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub>H<sub class="subscript">2</sub><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub><sub class="subscript">+2</sub> where <em class="emphasis">n</em> is an integer; alkenes, represented by C<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub>H<sub class="subscript">2</sub><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub>; alkynes, represented by C<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub>H<sub class="subscript">2</sub><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub><sub class="subscript">−2</sub>; and arenes. Halogen-substituted alkanes, alkenes, and arenes form a second major family of organic compounds, which include the alkyl halides and the aryl halides. Oxygen-containing organic compounds, a third family, may be divided into two main types: those that contain at least one C–O bond, which include alcohols, phenols (derivatives of benzene), and ethers, and those that contain a carbonyl group (C=O), which include aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acid derivatives, the fourth family listed, are compounds in which the OH of the –CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>H functional group is replaced by either an alkoxy (–OR) group, producing an ester, or by an amido (–NRR′, where R and R′ can be H and/or alkyl groups), forming an amide. Nitrogen-containing organic compounds, the fifth family, include amines; nitriles, which have a C≡N bond; and nitro compounds, which contain the –NO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> group.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s01_p03">As you learned in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch02#averill_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Molecules, Ions, and Chemical Formulas"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch02_s04#averill_1.0-ch02_s04">Section 2.4 "Naming Covalent Compounds"</a>, the systematic nomenclature of organic compounds indicates the positions of substituents using the lowest numbers possible to identify their locations in the carbon chain of the parent compound. If two compounds have the same systematic name, then they are the same compound. Although systematic names are preferred because they are unambiguous, many organic compounds are known by their common names rather than their systematic names. Common nomenclature uses the prefix <em class="emphasis">form</em>—for a compound that contains no carbons other than those in the functional group, and <em class="emphasis">acet</em>—for those that have one carbon atom in addition [two in the case of acetone, (CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>)<sub class="subscript">2</sub>C=O]. Thus methanal and ethanal, respectively, are the systematic names for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s01_p04">Recall that in the systematic nomenclature of aromatic compounds, the positions of groups attached to the aromatic ring are indicated by numbers, starting with 1 and proceeding around the ring in the direction that produces the lowest possible numbers. For example, the position of the first CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub> group in dimethyl benzene is indicated with a 1, but the second CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub> group, which can be placed in any one of three positions, produces 1,2-dimethylbenzene, 1,3-dimethylbenzene, or 1,4-dimethylbenzene (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s01_f02">Figure 24.2 "Common Nomenclature for Aromatic Ring Substitutions"</a>). In common nomenclature, in contrast, the prefixes <em class="emphasis">ortho</em>-, <em class="emphasis">meta</em>-, and <em class="emphasis">para</em>- are used to describe the relative positions of groups attached to an aromatic ring. If the CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub> groups in dimethylbenzene, whose common name is xylene, are adjacent to each other, the compound is commonly called <em class="emphasis">ortho</em>-xylene, abbreviated <em class="emphasis">o</em>-xylene. If they are across from each other on the ring, the compound is commonly called <em class="emphasis">para</em>-xylene or <em class="emphasis">p</em>-xylene.

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s02_p01">In earlier discussions of organic compounds, we focused on differences in how the functional groups were connected to the carbon framework. Differences in connectivity resulted in different chemical compounds with different names. You learned, for example, that although 1-propanol (<em class="emphasis">n</em>-propanol) and 2-propanol (isopropanol) have the same molecular formula (C<sub class="subscript">3</sub>H<sub class="subscript">8</sub>O), they have different physical and chemical properties. Just as with metal complexes, compounds that have the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms are called isomers. (For more information on metal complexes, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch23#averill_1.0-ch23">Chapter 23 "The "</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch23_s04#averill_1.0-ch23_s04">Section 23.4 "Coordination Compounds"</a>.)

In the fully eclipsed conformation, the C–H bonds on adjacent carbon atoms are parallel and lie in the same plane. In the staggered conformation, the hydrogen atoms are positioned as far apart as possible.

(For more information on bond angles and molecular modeling, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch02#averill_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Molecules, Ions, and Chemical Formulas"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch02_s01#averill_1.0-ch02_s01">Section 2.1 "Chemical Compounds"</a>.) Despite this three-dimensional inaccuracy, Newman projections are useful for predicting the relative stability of conformational isomers. As shown in part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s01_f02">Figure 24.4 "Eclipsed and Staggered Conformations of Ethane"</a>, the higher energy of the eclipsed conformation represents an energy barrier of 12.6 kJ/mol that must be overcome for rotation about the C–C bond to occur. This barrier is so low, however, that rotation about the C–C bond in ethane is very fast at room temperature and occurs several million times per second for each molecule.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s01_p05">Longer-chain alkanes can also be represented by Newman projections.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s03_p01">Molecules with the same connectivity but different arrangements of the atoms in space are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stereoisomers</a><span class="glossdef">Molecules that have the same connectivity but whose component atoms have different orientations in space.</span></span>. There are two types of stereoisomers: geometric and optical. <em class="emphasis">Geometric isomers</em> differ in the relative position(s) of substituents in a rigid molecule. (For more information on stereoisomers, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch23#averill_1.0-ch23">Chapter 23 "The "</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch23_s04#averill_1.0-ch23_s04">Section 23.4 "Coordination Compounds"</a>.) Simple rotation about a C–C σ bond in an alkene, for example, cannot occur because of the presence of the π bond. The substituents are therefore rigidly locked into a particular spatial arrangement (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch02_s04#averill_1.0-ch02_s04_s02_s02_f01">Figure 2.16 "Some Simple (a) Alkenes, (b) Alkynes, and (c) Cyclic Hydrocarbons"</a>). Thus a carbon–carbon multiple bond, or in some cases a ring, prevents one geometric isomer from being readily converted to the other. The members of an isomeric pair are identified as either <em class="emphasis">cis</em> or <em class="emphasis">trans</em>, and interconversion between the two forms requires breaking and reforming one or more bonds. Because their structural difference causes them to have different physical and chemical properties, <em class="emphasis">cis</em> and <em class="emphasis">trans</em> isomers are actually two distinct chemical compounds.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s03_s02_p01">In living organisms, virtually every molecule that contains a chiral center is found as a single enantiomer, not a racemic mixture. At the molecular level, our bodies are chiral and interact differently with the individual enantiomers of a particular compound. For example, the two enantiomers of carvone produce very different responses in humans: (−)-carvone is the substance responsible for the smell of spearment oil, and (+)-carvone—the major flavor component of caraway seeds—is responsible for the characteristic aroma of rye bread.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s03_s02_p02">A pharmaceutical example of a chiral compound is ibuprofen, a common analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent that is the active ingredient in pain relievers such as Motrin and Advil (<a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch24_s05#averill_1.0-ch24_s05_s02_f01">Figure 24.16 "Biologically Active Substituted Arenes"</a>). The drug is sold as a racemic mixture that takes approximately 38 minutes to achieve its full effect in relieving pain and swelling in an adult human. Because only the (+) enantiomer is active in humans, however, the same mass of medication would relieve symptoms in only about 12 minutes if it consisted of only the (+) enantiomer. Unfortunately, isolating only the (+) enantiomer would substantially increase the cost of the drug. Conversion of the (−) to (+) enantiomer in the human body accounts for the delay in feeling the full effects of the drug. A racemic mixture of another drug, the sedative thalidomide, was sold in Europe from 1956 to the early 1960s. It was prescribed to treat nausea during pregnancy, but unfortunately only the (+) enantiomer was safe for that purpose. The (−) enantiomer was discovered to be a relatively potent <em class="emphasis">teratogen</em>, a substance that causes birth defects, which caused the children of many women who had taken thalidomide to be born with missing or undeveloped limbs. As a result, thalidomide was quickly banned for this use. It is currently used to treat leprosy, however, and it has also shown promise as a treatment for AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s03_s02_p03">These examples dramatically illustrate the point that the biological activities of enantiomers may be very different. But how can two molecules that differ only by being nonsuperimposable mirror images cause such different responses? The biological effects of many substances—including molecules such as carvone that have a scent and drugs such as ibuprofen and thalidomide—depend on their interaction with chiral sites on specific receptor proteins. As schematically illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s03_s02_f01">Figure 24.10 "The Interaction of Chiral Molecules with Biological Receptors"</a>, only one enantiomer of a chiral substance interacts with a particular receptor, thereby initiating a response.

Stereoisomers can be geometric isomers, which differ in the placement of substituents in a rigid molecule, or optical isomers, nonsuperimposable mirror images. Molecules that are nonsuperimposable mirror images are chiral molecules. A molecule and its nonsuperimposable mirror image are called enantiomers. These differ in their interaction with plane-polarized light, light that oscillates in only one direction. A compound is optically active if its solution rotates plane-polarized light in only one direction and optically inactive if its rotations cancel to produce no net rotation. A clockwise rotation is called dextrorotatory and is indicated in the compound’s name by (+), whereas a counterclockwise rotation is called levorotatory, designated by (−).

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s03_p01">Understanding why organic molecules react as they do requires knowing something about the structure and properties of the transient species that are generated during chemical reactions. Identifying transient intermediates enables chemists to elucidate reaction mechanisms, which often allows them to control the products of a reaction. In designing the synthesis of a molecule, such as a new drug, for example, chemists must be able to understand the mechanisms of intermediate reactions to maximize the yield of the desired product and minimize the occurrence of unwanted reactions. Moreover, by recognizing the common reaction mechanisms of simple organic molecules, we can understand how more complex systems react, including the much larger molecules encountered in biochemistry.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s03_p02">Nearly all chemical reactions, whether organic or inorganic, proceed because atoms or groups of atoms having a positive charge or a partial positive charge interact with atoms or groups of atoms having a negative charge or a partial negative charge. Thus when a bond in a hydrocarbon is cleaved during a reaction, identifying the transient species formed, some of which are charged, allows chemists to determine the mechanism and predict the products of a reaction.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s03_p03">Chemists often find that the reactivity of a molecule is affected by the degree of substitution of a carbon that is bonded to a functional group. These carbons are designated as <em class="emphasis">primary</em>, <em class="emphasis">secondary</em>, or <em class="emphasis">tertiary</em>. A primary carbon is bonded to only one other carbon and a functional group, a secondary carbon is bonded to two other carbons and a functional group, and a tertiary carbon is bonded to three other carbons and a functional group.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s03_s01_p01">Cleaving a C–H bond can generate either –C<sup class="superscript">+</sup> and H<sup class="superscript">−</sup>, −C· and H· or −C<sup class="superscript">−</sup> and H<sup class="superscript">+</sup>, all of which are unstable and therefore highly reactive.

(Recall that electron-deficient compounds, such as those of the group 13 elements, act as Lewis acids in inorganic reactions.) In general, when a highly electronegative atom, such as Cl, is bonded to a carbocation, it draws electrons away from the carbon and destabilizes the positive charge. In contrast, alkyl groups and other species stabilize the positive charge by increasing electron density at the carbocation. Thus a tertiary carbocation (R<sub class="subscript">3</sub>C<sup class="superscript">+</sup>) is more stable than a primary carbocation (RCH<sub class="subscript">2</sub><sup class="superscript">+</sup>).</p>

Because the carbon still has less than an octet of electrons, it is electron deficient and also behaves as an electrophile. Like carbocations, radicals can be stabilized by carbon substituents that can donate some electron density to the electron-deficient carbon center.

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s03_s01_p15">The reactivity of a molecule is often affected by the degree of substitution of the carbon bonded to a functional group; the carbon is designated as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Identifying the transient species formed in a chemical reaction, some of which are charged, enables chemists to predict the mechanism and products of the reaction. One common transient species is a <strong class="emphasis bold">carbocation</strong>, a carbon with six valence electrons that is an <strong class="emphasis bold">electrophile</strong>; that is, it needs electrons to complete its octet. A <strong class="emphasis bold">radical</strong> is a transient species that is neutral but electron deficient and thus acts as an electrophile. In contrast, a <strong class="emphasis bold">carbanion</strong> has eight valence electrons and is negatively charged. It is an electron-rich species that is a <strong class="emphasis bold">nucleophile</strong> because it can share a pair of electrons. In chemical reactions, electrophiles react with nucleophiles.</p>

In this section, we discuss five common types of organic reactions: substitution reactions, elimination reactions, addition reactions, radical reactions, and oxidation–reduction reactions. You have encountered many of these types of reactions previously, such as the formation of peptides by the elimination of water, the oxidation–reduction reactions that generate voltage in batteries, and chain reactions that involve organic radicals. (For more information on peptide formation, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12#averill_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Solids"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12_s08#averill_1.0-ch12_s08">Section 12.8 "Polymeric Solids"</a>.

Mustard gas is toxic because it contains a chloride that can be displaced by nucleophilic amino groups in proteins, thereby allowing the molecule to irreversibly bond to a protein. Because the other product of the reaction is HCl, mustard gas causes severe burns to mucous membranes in the respiratory tract. If mustard gas reacts with DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), cross-linking of the DNA strands through sulfur occurs, which results in coding errors, the inhibition of replication, and disruption of other DNA functions. If mustard gas reacts with RNA (ribonucleic acid), protein synthesis is altered (see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch24_s06#averill_1.0-ch24_s06">Section 24.6 "The Molecules of Life"</a>).</p>

Hence alkenes and alkynes are regarded as functional groups. Nucleophilic attack occurs on the H<sup class="superscript">δ+</sup> atom of the polar HCl bond, initially producing a species with a carbon that has only three bonds, a carbocation.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s04_s05_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Oxidation–reduction reactions</strong>, which are common in organic chemistry, can often be identified by changes in the number of oxygen atoms at a particular position in the hydrocarbon skeleton or in the number of bonds between carbon and oxygen at that position. An increase in either corresponds to an oxidation, whereas a decrease corresponds to a reduction. Conversely, an increase in the number of hydrogen atoms in a hydrocarbon is often an indication of a reduction. We can illustrate these points by considering how the oxidation state of the carbon atom changes in the series of compounds, which is shown in part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s04_s05_f01">Figure 24.14 "The Oxidation State of Carbon in Oxygen- and Nitrogen-Containing Functional Groups"</a>. (For a review of oxidation states and formal changes, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch03#averill_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "Chemical Reactions"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch03_s05#averill_1.0-ch03_s05">Section 3.5 "Classifying Chemical Reactions"</a>, and <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch08#averill_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Ionic versus Covalent Bonding"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch08_s05#averill_1.0-ch08_s05">Section 8.5 "Lewis Structures and Covalent Bonding"</a>). The number of oxygen atoms or the number of bonds to oxygen changes throughout the series. Hence the conversion of methane to formic acid is an oxidation, whereas the conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol is a reduction. Also, the number of hydrogen atoms increases in going from the most oxidized to least oxidized compound. As expected, as the oxidation state of carbon increases, the carbon becomes a more potent electrophile. Thus the carbon of CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> is a stronger electrophile (i.e., more susceptible to nucleophilic attack) than the carbon of an alkane such as methane.</p>

            <p class="para">(a) In a hydrocarbon, oxidation is indicated by an increase in the number of oxygen atoms or carbon–oxygen bonds or a decrease in the number of hydrogen atoms.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s04_s05_p02">Similarly, in compounds with a carbon–nitrogen bond, the number of bonds between the C and N atoms increases as the oxidation state of the carbon increases (part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s04_s05_f01">Figure 24.14 "The Oxidation State of Carbon in Oxygen- and Nitrogen-Containing Functional Groups"</a>). In a nitrile, which contains the –C≡N group, the carbon has the same oxidation state (+2) as in a carboxylic acid, characterized by the –CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>H group.

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s04_s05_p14">There are common patterns to how organic reactions occur. In a <strong class="emphasis bold">substitution reaction</strong>, one atom or a group of atoms in a substance is replaced by another atom or a group of atoms from another substance. Bulky groups that prevent attack cause the reaction to be sterically hindered. In an <strong class="emphasis bold">elimination reaction</strong>, adjacent atoms are removed with subsequent formation of a multiple bond and a small molecule. An <strong class="emphasis bold">addition reaction</strong> is the reverse of an elimination reaction. Radical reactions are not very selective and occur in three stages: initiation, propagation, and termination. <strong class="emphasis bold">Oxidation–reduction reactions</strong> in organic chemistry are identified by the change in the number of oxygens in the hydrocarbon skeleton or the number of bonds between carbon and oxygen or carbon and nitrogen.</p>

In contrast, the melting points of alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes with similar molecular masses show a much wider variation because the melting point strongly depends on how the molecules stack in the solid state. It is therefore sensitive to relatively small differences in structure, such as the location of a double bond and whether the molecule is <em class="emphasis">cis</em> or <em class="emphasis">trans</em>.</p>

Consequently, their reactivity is limited, and often their reactions occur only under extreme conditions. For example, <em class="emphasis">catalytic cracking</em> can be used to convert straight-chain alkanes to highly branched alkanes, which are better fuels for internal combustion engines. Catalytic cracking is one example of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pyrolysis reaction</a><span class="glossdef">A high-temperature decomposition reaction that can be used to form fibers of synthetic polymers.</span></span> (from the Greek <em class="emphasis">pyros</em>, meaning “fire,” and <em class="emphasis">lysis</em>, meaning “loosening”), in which alkanes are heated to a sufficiently high temperature to induce cleavage of the weakest bonds: the C–C single bonds.

In the gas phase, the dipole moment of benzene is zero, but the presence of electronegative or electropositive substituents can result in a net dipole moment that increases intermolecular attractive forces and raises the melting and boiling points. For example, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, a compound used as an alternative to naphthalene in the production of mothballs, has a melting point of 52.7°C, which is considerably greater than the melting point of benzene (5.5°C).

Because of the electronegative oxygen atom, the individual O–H bond dipoles in alcohols cannot cancel one another, resulting in a substantial dipole moment that allows alcohols to form hydrogen bonds. Alcohols therefore have significantly higher boiling points than alkanes or alkenes of comparable molecular mass, whereas ethers, without a polar O–H bond, have intermediate boiling points due to the presence of a small dipole moment (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s05_s03_t01">Table 24.2 "Boiling Points of Alkanes, Ethers, and Alcohols of Comparable Molecular Mass"</a>). The larger the alkyl group in the molecule, however, the more “alkane-like” the alcohol is in its properties. Because of their polar nature, alcohols and ethers tend to be good solvents for a wide range of organic compounds.</p>

Conversely, the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group allow electrophilic attack to occur.

These reagents are named for the French chemist Victor Grignard (1871–1935), who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1912 for their development. In a Grignard reaction, the carbonyl functional group is converted to an alcohol, and the carbon chain of the carbonyl compound is lengthened by the addition of the R group from the Grignard reagent. One example is reacting cyclohexylmagnesium chloride, a Grignard reagent, with formaldehyde:</p>

The boiling points of carboxylic acids tend to be somewhat higher than would be expected from their molecular masses because of strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between molecules. In fact, most simple carboxylic acids form dimers in the liquid and even in the vapor phase. (For more information on the vapor phase, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch11#averill_1.0-ch11">Chapter 11 "Liquids"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch11_s02#averill_1.0-ch11_s02">Section 11.2 "Intermolecular Forces"</a>.) The four lightest carboxylic acids are completely miscible with water, but as the alkyl chain lengthens, they become more “alkane-like,” so their solubility in water decreases.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s05_s07_p01">Amines are derivatives of ammonia in which one or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced by alkyl or aryl groups. They are therefore analogous to alcohols and ethers. Like alcohols, amines are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary, but in this case the designation refers to the number of alkyl groups bonded to the nitrogen atom, not to the number of adjacent carbon atoms. In primary amines, the nitrogen is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and one alkyl group; in secondary amines, the nitrogen is bonded to one hydrogen and two alkyl groups; and in tertiary amines, the nitrogen is bonded to three alkyl groups. With one lone pair of electrons and C–N bonds that are less polar than C–O bonds, ammonia and simple amines have much lower boiling points than water or alcohols with similar molecular masses. Primary amines tend to have boiling points intermediate between those of the corresponding alcohol and alkane. Moreover, secondary and tertiary amines have lower boiling points than primary amines of comparable molecular mass.</p>

When chemists plan the synthesis of an organic molecule, however, they must take into consideration various factors, such as the availability and cost of reactants, the need to minimize the formation of undesired products, and the proper sequencing of reactions to maximize the yield of the target molecule and minimize the formation of undesired products. Because the synthesis of many organic molecules requires multiple steps, in designing a synthetic scheme for such molecules, chemists must often work backward from the desired product in a process called <em class="emphasis">retrosynthesis</em>. Using this process, they can identify the reaction steps needed to synthesize the desired product from the available reactants.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s05_s07_p17">There are strong connections among the structure, the physical properties, and the reactivity for compounds that contain the major functional groups. Hydrocarbons that are alkanes undergo catalytic cracking, which can convert straight-chain alkanes to highly branched alkanes. Catalytic cracking is one example of a <strong class="emphasis bold">pyrolysis reaction</strong>, in which the weakest bond is cleaved at high temperature, producing a mixture of radicals. The multiple bond of an alkene produces geometric isomers (<em class="emphasis">cis</em> and <em class="emphasis">trans</em>). Terminal alkynes contain a hydrogen atom directly attached to a triply bonded carbon. Removal of the hydrogen forms an acetylide ion, a potent nucleophile used to make longer carbon chains. Arenes undergo substitution rather than elimination because of enhanced stability from delocalization of their π electron density. An alcohol is often prepared by adding the elements of water across a double bond or by a substitution reaction. Alcohols undergo two major types of reactions: those involving cleavage of the O–H bond and those involving cleavage of the C–O bond. Phenols are acidic because of π interactions between the oxygen atom and the ring. Ethers are comparatively unreactive. Aldehydes and ketones are generally prepared by oxidizing alcohols. Their chemistry is characterized by nucleophilic attack at the carbon atom of the carbonyl functional group and electrophilic attack at the oxygen atom. <strong class="emphasis bold">Grignard reagents</strong> (RMgX, where X is Cl, Br, or I) convert the carbonyl functional group to an alcohol and lengthen the carbon chain. Compounds that contain the carboxyl functional group are weakly acidic because of delocalization of the π electrons, which causes them to easily lose a proton and form the carboxylate anion. Carboxylic acids are generally prepared by oxidizing alcohols and aldehydes or reacting a Grignard reagent with CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>. Carboxylic acid derivatives include esters, prepared by reacting a carboxylic acid and an alcohol, and amides, prepared by the nucleophilic reaction of amines with more electrophilic carboxylic acid derivatives, such as esters. Amides are relatively unreactive because of π bonding interactions between the lone pair on nitrogen and the carbonyl group. Amines can also be primary, secondary, or tertiary, depending on the number of alkyl groups bonded to the amine. <strong class="emphasis bold">Quaternary ammonium salts</strong> have four substituents attached to nitrogen and can be chiral. Amines are often prepared by a nucleophilic substitution reaction between a polar alkyl halide and ammonia or other amines. They are nucleophiles, but their base strength depends on their substituents.</p>

A detailed understanding of the reactions that occur in living organisms is the goal of biochemistry, which deals with a wide variety of organic structures and reactions. The most abundant substances found in living systems belong to four major classes: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids. Here we briefly describe the structure and some functions of these biological molecules.</p>

In the simplest amino acid, glycine, the R group is hydrogen (–H), but in other naturally occurring amino acids, the R group may be an alkyl group or a substituted alkyl group, a carboxylic group, or an aryl group. The nature of the R group determines the particular chemical properties of each amino acid. In <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05_s04#averill_1.0-ch05_s04_f01">Figure 5.16 "The Structures of 10 Amino Acids"</a>, all the amino acids found in proteins except glycine are chiral compounds, which suggests that their interactions with other chiral compounds are selective. Some proteins, called enzymes, catalyze biological reactions, whereas many others have structural, contractile, or signaling functions. Because we have described proteins previously, we will not discuss them further.</p>

The simplest carbohydrates consist of unbranched chains of three to eight carbon atoms: one carbon atom is part of a carbonyl group, and some or all of the others are bonded to hydroxyl groups. The structure of a carbohydrate can be drawn either as a hydrocarbon chain, using a <em class="emphasis">Fischer projection</em>, or as a ring, using a <em class="emphasis">Haworth projection</em> (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s06_s02_f01">Figure 24.21 "Fischer Projection and Haworth Projection of Glucose"</a>). The Haworth projection is named after the British chemist Sir Walter Norman Haworth, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937 for his discovery that sugars exist mainly in their cyclic forms, as well as for his collaboration on the synthesis of vitamin C. The cyclic form is the product of nucleophilic attack by the oxygen of a hydroxyl group on the electrophilic carbon of the carbonyl group within the same molecule, producing a stable ring structure composed of five or six carbons that minimizes bond strain (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s06_s02_f01">Figure 24.21 "Fischer Projection and Haworth Projection of Glucose"</a>). The substituents on the right side of the carbon chain in a Fischer projection are in the “down” position in the corresponding Haworth projection. Attack by the hydroxyl group on either side of the carbonyl group leads to the formation of two cyclic forms, called <em class="emphasis">anomers</em>: an α form, with the –OH in the “down” position, and a β form, with the –OH in the “up” position.</p>

The carbonyl group, for example, can be oxidized to form a carboxylic acid or reduced to form an alcohol. The hydroxyl groups can undergo substitution reactions, resulting in derivatives of the original compound. One such derivative is Sucralose, an artificial sweetener that is six times sweeter than sucrose; it is made by replacing two of the hydroxyl groups on sucrose with chlorine. Carbohydrates can also eliminate hydroxyl groups, producing alkenes.</p>

A buildup of plaque can block a coronary artery and result in a heart attack (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s06_s03_f02">Figure 24.24 "Plaque in an Artery"</a>).</p>

Chloramphenicol, for example, is used against infections of the eye or outer ear canal; it inhibits the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids in a protein chain.

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s06_s04_p07"><strong class="emphasis bold">Proteins</strong> are biologically active polymers formed from amino acids linked together by amide bonds. All the amino acids in proteins are chiral compounds except glycine. The most common organic compounds found in nature are the <strong class="emphasis bold">carbohydrates</strong>, polyhydroxy aldehydes or polyhydroxy ketones in unbranched chains of three to eight carbons. They are classified according to the number of sugar, or saccharide, units, and they can be drawn as a chain in a Fischer projection or in a cyclic form called a Haworth projection. The two cyclic forms in a Haworth projection are called anomers. Many sugars contain at least one chiral center. With their carbonyl and hydroxyl functional groups, carbohydrates can undergo a variety of biochemically relevant reactions. Starch and cellulose differ only in the connectivity between glucose units. Starches can be branched or unbranched, but cellulose, the structural material of plants, is unbranched, and cannot be digested by humans. <strong class="emphasis bold">Lipids</strong> are insoluble in water. The simplest lipids, fatty acids, have a long hydrocarbon chain ending in a carboxylic acid functional group. Their physical properties depend on the number of double bonds in the chain. Prostaglandins, hormone-like substances, are formed from unsaturated fatty acids, and waxes are long-chain esters of saturated fatty acids. Triacylglycerols, which the body uses to store fats and oils, consist of glycerol esterified to three fatty acid molecules. Steroids, which include cholesterol and the steroid hormones, are characterized by three cyclohexane rings and one cyclopentane ring fused together. The basic structural units of DNA and RNA are the <strong class="emphasis bold">nucleic acids</strong>, whose structures are derived from nitrogen-containing cyclic compounds called pyrimidines and purines. These structures are linked to a sugar through a glycosidic bond, forming a nucleoside. Adding a phosphoric acid group produces a nucleotide. Nucleotides link to form a polymeric chain that is the backbone of DNA and RNA.</p>
