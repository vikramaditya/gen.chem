The color of the emitted light is determined in part by the band gap of the semiconductor. Electrons can be promoted to the conduction band and return to the valence band by emitting light or by increasing the magnitude of atomic vibrations in the crystal, which increases its temperature.

                    <p class="para">♦ Strips of pure Au and Al are often used in close proximity to each other on circuit boards. As the boards become warm during use, however, the metals can diffuse, forming a purple alloy known as “the purple plague” between the strips. Because the alloy is electrically conductive, the board short-circuits. A structural analysis of the purple alloy showed that its structure contained a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice of atoms of one element, with atoms of the other element occupying tetrahedral holes. What type of alloy is this? Which element is most likely to form the fcc lattice? Which element is most likely to occupy the tetrahedral holes? Explain your answers.

The crystalline lattice of the glass former breaks down during heating, producing the random atomic arrangements typical of a liquid. Adding a modifier and cooling the melt rapidly produces a glass.
