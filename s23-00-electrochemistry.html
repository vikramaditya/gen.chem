    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch19_p01">In oxidation–reduction (redox) reactions, electrons are transferred from one species (the reductant) to another (the oxidant). This transfer of electrons provides a means for converting chemical energy to electrical energy or vice versa. The study of the relationship between electricity and chemical reactions is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">electrochemistry</a><span class="glossdef">The study of the relationship between electricity and chemical reactions.</span></span>, an area of chemistry we introduced in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch04#averill_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "Reactions in Aqueous Solution"</a> and <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05#averill_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions"</a>. In this chapter, we describe electrochemical reactions in more depth and explore some of their applications.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch19_p02">In the first three sections, we review redox reactions; describe how they can be used to generate an electrical potential, or <em class="emphasis">voltage</em>; and discuss factors that affect the magnitude of the potential. We then explore the relationships among the electrical potential, the change in free energy, and the equilibrium constant for a redox reaction, which are all measures of the thermodynamic driving force for a reaction. Finally, we examine two kinds of applications of electrochemical principles: (1) those in which a spontaneous reaction is used to provide electricity and (2) those in which electrical energy is used to drive a thermodynamically nonspontaneous reaction. By the end of this chapter, you will understand why different kinds of batteries are used in cars, flashlights, cameras, and portable computers; how rechargeable batteries operate; and why corrosion occurs and how to slow—if not prevent—it. You will also discover how metal objects can be plated with silver or chromium for protection; how silver polish removes tarnish; and how to calculate the amount of electricity needed to produce aluminum, chlorine, copper, and sodium on an industrial scale.</p>
