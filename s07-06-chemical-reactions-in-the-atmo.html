A less extensive zone of depletion has been detected over the Arctic as well. Years of study from the ground, from the air, and from satellites in space have shown that chlorine from industrial chemicals used in spray cans, foam packaging, and refrigeration materials is largely responsible for the catalytic depletion of ozone through a series of condensation, cleavage, and oxidation–reduction reactions.</p>

A key feature of the atmosphere is that its composition, temperature, and pressure vary dramatically with altitude. Consequently, scientists have divided the atmosphere into distinct layers, which interact differently with the continuous flux of solar radiation from the top and the land and ocean masses at the bottom.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch03_s06_s01_p14">Because the stratosphere is relatively isolated from the layers of the atmosphere above and below it, once chlorine-containing species enter the stratosphere, they remain there for long periods of time. Each chlorine atom produced from a CFC molecule can lead to the destruction of large numbers of ozone molecules, thereby decreasing the concentration of ozone in the stratosphere. Eventually, however, the chlorine atom reacts with a water molecule to form hydrochloric acid, which is carried back into the troposphere and then washed out of the atmosphere in rainfall.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch03_s06_s02_p04">Stratospheric ozone levels decreased about 2.5% from 1978 to 1988, which coincided with a fivefold increase in the widespread use of CFCs since the 1950s. If the trend were allowed to continue, the results could be catastrophic. Fortunately, many countries have banned the use of CFCs in aerosols. In 1987, representatives from 43 nations signed the Montreal Protocol, committing themselves to reducing CFC emissions by 50% by the year 2000. Later, representatives from a large number of countries, alarmed by data showing the rapid depletion of stratospheric chlorine, agreed to phase out CFCs completely by the early 21st century; the United States banned their use in 1995. The projected effects of these agreements on atmospheric chlorine levels are shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch03_s06_s02_f01">Figure 3.17 "Projected Effects of International Agreements on Atmospheric Chlorine Levels"</a>. Because of the very slow rate at which CFCs are removed from the stratosphere, however, stratospheric chlorine levels will not fall to the level at which the Antarctic ozone hole was first observed until about 2050. The scientific community recognized Molina and Rowland’s work in 1995, when they shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>

Based on these reactions, the development of commercial supersonic transports is not recommended until the environmental impact has undergone additional testing. (Although these reactions have been observed, they do not appear to be a major factor in ozone destruction.)</p>

            <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch03_s06_s02_p18">Earth’s atmosphere consists of discrete layers that do not mix readily with one another. The sun emits radiation with a wide range of energies, including <strong class="emphasis bold">visible light</strong>, which can be detected by the human eye, and <strong class="emphasis bold">ultraviolet light</strong>, which is more energetic than visible light and cannot be detected by the human eye. In the stratosphere, ultraviolet light reacts with O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> molecules to form atomic oxygen. Atomic oxygen then reacts with an O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> molecule to produce <strong class="emphasis bold">ozone</strong> (O<sub class="subscript">3</sub>). As a result of this reaction, the stratosphere contains an appreciable concentration of ozone molecules that constitutes the <strong class="emphasis bold">ozone layer</strong>. The absorption of ultraviolet light in the stratosphere protects Earth’s surface from the sun’s harmful effects. Volatile organic compounds that contain chlorine and fluorine, which are known as <em class="emphasis">chlorofluorocarbons</em> (<em class="emphasis">CFCs</em>), are capable of reaching the stratosphere, where they can react with ultraviolet light to generate chlorine atoms and other chlorine-containing species that catalyze the conversion of ozone to O<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, thereby decreasing the amount of O<sub class="subscript">3</sub> in the stratosphere. Replacing chlorofluorocarbons with <em class="emphasis">hydrochlorofluorocarbons</em> (<em class="emphasis">HCFCs</em>) or <em class="emphasis">hydrofluorocarbons</em> (<em class="emphasis">HFCs</em>) is one strategy that has been developed to minimize further damage to Earth’s ozone layer.</p>
