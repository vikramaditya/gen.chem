    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_p01">It was not until the era of the ancient Greeks that we have any record of how people tried to explain the chemical changes they observed and used. At that time, natural objects were thought to consist of only four basic elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Then, in the fourth century BC, two Greek philosophers, Democritus and Leucippus, suggested that matter was not infinitely divisible into smaller particles but instead consisted of fundamental, indivisible particles called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">atoms</a><span class="glossdef">The fundamental, individual particles of which matter is composed.</span></span>. Unfortunately, these early philosophers did not have the technology to test their hypothesis. They would have been unlikely to do so in any case because the ancient Greeks did not conduct experiments or use the scientific method. They believed that the nature of the universe could be discovered by rational thought alone.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_p02">Over the next two millennia, <em class="emphasis">alchemists</em>, who engaged in a form of chemistry and speculative philosophy during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, achieved many advances in chemistry. Their major goal was to convert certain elements into others by a process they called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transmutation</a><span class="glossdef">The process of converting one element to another.</span></span> (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s04_f01">Figure 1.13 "An Alchemist at Work"</a>). In particular, alchemists wanted to find a way to transform cheaper metals into gold. Although most alchemists did not approach chemistry systematically and many appear to have been outright frauds, alchemists in China, the Arab kingdoms, and medieval Europe made major contributions, including the discovery of elements such as quicksilver (mercury) and the preparation of several strong acids.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Modern Chemistry</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p01">The 16th and 17th centuries saw the beginnings of what we now recognize as modern chemistry. During this period, great advances were made in <em class="emphasis">metallurgy</em>, the extraction of metals from ores, and the first systematic quantitative experiments were carried out. In 1661, the Englishman Robert Boyle (1627–91) published <em class="emphasis">The Sceptical Chymist</em>, which described the relationship between the pressure and the volume of air. More important, Boyle defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into two or more simpler substances by chemical means. This led to the identification of a large number of elements, many of which were metals. Ironically, Boyle himself never thought that metals were elements.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p02">In the 18th century, the English clergyman Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) discovered oxygen gas and found that many carbon-containing materials burn vigorously in an oxygen atmosphere, a process called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">combustion</a><span class="glossdef">The burning of a material in an oxygen atmosphere.</span></span>. Priestley also discovered that the gas produced by fermenting beer, which we now know to be carbon dioxide, is the same as one of the gaseous products of combustion. Priestley’s studies of this gas did not continue as he would have liked, however. After he fell into a vat of fermenting beer, brewers prohibited him from working in their factories. Although Priestley did not understand its identity, he found that carbon dioxide dissolved in water to produce seltzer water. In essence, he may be considered the founder of the multibillion-dollar carbonated soft drink industry.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Joseph Priestley (1733–1804)</h3>
            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p03">Priestley was a political theorist and a leading Unitarian minister. He was appointed to Warrington Academy in Lancashire, England, where he developed new courses on history, science, and the arts. During visits to London, Priestley met the leading men of science, including Benjamin Franklin, who encouraged Priestley’s interest in electricity. Priestley’s work on gases began while he was living next to a brewery in Leeds, where he noticed “fixed air” bubbling out of vats of fermenting beer and ale. His scientific discoveries included the relationship between electricity and chemical change, 10 new “airs,” and observations that led to the discovery of photosynthesis. Due to his support for the principles of the French Revolution, Priestley’s house, library, and laboratory were destroyed by a mob in 1791. He and his wife emigrated to the United States in 1794 to join their three sons, who had previously emigrated to Pennsylvania. Priestley never returned to England and died in his new home in Pennsylvania.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p04">Despite the pioneering studies of Priestley and others, a clear understanding of combustion remained elusive. In the late 18th century, however, the French scientist Antoine Lavoisier (1743–94) showed that combustion is the reaction of a carbon-containing substance with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water and that life depends on a similar reaction, which today we call <em class="emphasis">respiration</em>. Lavoisier also wrote the first modern chemistry text and is widely regarded as the father of modern chemistry. His most important contribution was the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">law of conservation of mass</a><span class="glossdef">In any chemical reaction, the mass of the substances that react equals the mass of the products that are formed.</span></span>, which states that in any chemical reaction, the mass of the substances that react equals the mass of the products that are formed. That is, in a chemical reaction, mass is neither lost nor destroyed. Unfortunately, Lavoisier invested in a private corporation that collected taxes for the Crown, and royal tax collectors were not popular during the French Revolution. He was executed on the guillotine at age 51, prematurely terminating his contributions to chemistry.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Atomic Theory of Matter</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p01">In 1803, the English schoolteacher John Dalton (1766–1844) expanded Proust’s development of the <strong class="emphasis bold">law of definite proportions</strong> (<a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01_s02#averill_1.0-ch01_s02">Section 1.2 "The Scientific Method"</a>) and Lavoisier’s findings on the conservation of mass in chemical reactions to propose that elements consist of indivisible particles that he called <em class="emphasis">atoms</em> (taking the term from Democritus and Leucippus). Dalton’s <em class="emphasis">atomic theory of matter</em> contains four fundamental hypotheses:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>All matter is composed of tiny indivisible particles called atoms.</li>
            <li>All atoms of an element are identical in mass and chemical properties, whereas atoms of different elements differ in mass and fundamental chemical properties.</li>
            <li>A chemical compound is a substance that always contains the same atoms in the same ratio.</li>
            <li>In chemical reactions, atoms from one or more compounds or elements redistribute or rearrange in relation to other atoms to form one or more new compounds. <em class="emphasis">Atoms themselves do not undergo a change of identity in chemical reactions.</em>
</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p02">This last hypothesis suggested that the alchemists’ goal of transmuting other elements to gold was impossible, at least through chemical reactions. We now know that Dalton’s atomic theory is essentially correct, with four minor modifications:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_l02">
            <li>Not all atoms of an element must have precisely the same mass.</li>
            <li>Atoms of one element can be transformed into another through nuclear reactions.</li>
            <li>The compositions of many solid compounds are somewhat variable.</li>
            <li>Under certain circumstances, some atoms can be divided (split into smaller particles).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p03">These modifications illustrate the effectiveness of the scientific method; later experiments and observations were used to refine Dalton’s original theory.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Law of Multiple Proportions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s03_p01">Despite the clarity of his thinking, Dalton could not use his theory to determine the elemental compositions of chemical compounds because he had no reliable scale of atomic masses; that is, he did not know the relative masses of elements such as carbon and oxygen. For example, he knew that the gas we now call carbon monoxide contained carbon and oxygen in the ratio 1:1.33 by mass, and a second compound, the gas we call carbon dioxide, contained carbon and oxygen in the ratio 1:2.66 by mass. Because 2.66/1.33 = 2.00, the second compound contained twice as many oxygen atoms per carbon atom as did the first. But what was the correct formula for each compound? If the first compound consisted of particles that contain one carbon atom and one oxygen atom, the second must consist of particles that contain one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. If the first compound had two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom, the second must have two carbon atoms and two oxygen atoms. If the first had one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms, the second would have one carbon atom and four oxygen atoms, and so forth. Dalton had no way to distinguish among these or more complicated alternatives. However, these data led to a general statement that is now known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">law of multiple proportions</a><span class="glossdef">When two elements form a series of compounds, the ratios of the masses of the second element that are present per gram of the first element can almost always be expressed as the ratios of integers. (The same law holds for the mass ratios of compounds forming a series that contains more than two elements.)</span></span>: when two elements form a series of compounds, the ratios of the masses of the second element that are present per gram of the first element can almost always be expressed as the ratios of integers. (The same law holds for mass ratios of compounds forming a series that contains more than two elements.) Example 4 shows how the law of multiple proportions can be applied to determine the identity of a compound.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p01">In a further attempt to establish the formulas of chemical compounds, the French chemist Joseph Gay-Lussac (1778–1850) carried out a series of experiments using volume measurements. Under conditions of constant temperature and pressure, he carefully measured the volumes of gases that reacted to make a given chemical compound, together with the volumes of the products if they were gases. Gay-Lussac found, for example, that one volume of chlorine gas always reacted with one volume of hydrogen gas to produce two volumes of hydrogen chloride gas. Similarly, one volume of oxygen gas always reacted with two volumes of hydrogen gas to produce two volumes of water vapor (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_f01">Figure 1.14 "Gay-Lussac’s Experiments with Chlorine Gas and Hydrogen Gas"</a>).</p>

(b) A summary of Avogadro’s hypothesis, which interpreted Gay-Lussac’s results in terms of atoms. Note that the simplest way for two molecules of hydrogen chloride to be produced is if hydrogen and chlorine each consist of molecules that contain two atoms of the element.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p02">Gay-Lussac’s results did not by themselves reveal the formulas for hydrogen chloride and water. The Italian chemist Amadeo Avogadro (1776–1856) developed the key insight that led to the exact formulas. He proposed that when gases are measured at the same temperature and pressure, <em class="emphasis">equal volumes of different gases contain equal numbers of gas particles</em>. <em class="emphasis">Avogadro’s hypothesis</em>, which explained Gay-Lussac’s results, is summarized here and in part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_f01">Figure 1.14 "Gay-Lussac’s Experiments with Chlorine Gas and Hydrogen Gas"</a>:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p03">If Dalton’s theory of atoms was correct, then each particle of hydrogen or chlorine had to contain <em class="emphasis">at least two atoms</em> of hydrogen or chlorine because two particles of hydrogen chloride were produced. The simplest—but not the only—explanation was that hydrogen and chlorine contained two atoms each (i.e., they were <em class="emphasis">diatomic</em>) and that hydrogen chloride contained one atom each of hydrogen and chlorine. Applying this reasoning to Gay-Lussac’s results with hydrogen and oxygen leads to the conclusion that water contains two hydrogen atoms per oxygen atom. Unfortunately, because no data supported Avogadro’s hypothesis that equal volumes of gases contained equal numbers of particles, his explanations and formulas for simple compounds were not generally accepted for more than 50 years. Dalton and many others continued to believe that water particles contained one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom, rather than two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The historical development of the concept of the atom is summarized in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_f02">Figure 1.15 "A Summary of the Historical Development of the Concept of the Atom"</a>.</p>

Chemistry took its present scientific form in the 18th century, when careful quantitative experiments by Lavoisier, Proust, and Dalton resulted in the law of definite proportions, the <strong class="emphasis bold">law of conservation of mass</strong>, and the <strong class="emphasis bold">law of multiple proportions</strong>, which laid the groundwork for Dalton’s atomic theory of matter. In particular, Avogadro’s hypothesis provided the first link between the macroscopic properties of a substance (in this case, the volume of a gas) and the number of atoms or molecules present.</p>
