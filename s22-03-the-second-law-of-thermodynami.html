    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s03_p01">The first law of thermodynamics governs changes in the state function we have called internal energy (<em class="emphasis">E</em>). According to <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch18_s02#averill_1.0-ch18_s02">Section 18.2 "The First Law of Thermodynamics"</a>, changes in the internal energy (Δ<em class="emphasis">E</em>) are closely related to changes in the enthalpy (Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em>), which is a measure of the heat flow between a system and its surroundings at constant pressure. You also learned in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05#averill_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions"</a> that the enthalpy change for a chemical reaction can be calculated using tabulated values of enthalpies of formation. This information, however, does not tell us whether a particular process or reaction will occur spontaneously.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s03_p02">Let’s consider a familiar example of spontaneous change. If a hot frying pan that has just been removed from the stove is allowed to come into contact with a cooler object, such as cold water in a sink, heat will flow from the hotter object to the cooler one, in this case usually releasing steam. Eventually both objects will reach the same temperature, at a value between the initial temperatures of the two objects. This transfer of heat from a hot object to a cooler one obeys the first law of thermodynamics: energy is conserved.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s03_p03">Now consider the same process in reverse. Suppose that a hot frying pan in a sink of cold water were to become hotter while the water became cooler. As long as the same amount of thermal energy was gained by the frying pan and lost by the water, the first law of thermodynamics would be satisfied. Yet we all know that such a process cannot occur: heat always flows from a hot object to a cold one, never in the reverse direction. That is, <em class="emphasis">by itself</em> the magnitude of the heat flow associated with a process does not predict whether the process will occur spontaneously.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s03_p04">For many years, chemists and physicists tried to identify a single measurable quantity that would enable them to predict whether a particular process or reaction would occur spontaneously. Initially, many of them focused on enthalpy changes and hypothesized that an exothermic process would always be spontaneous. But although it is true that many, if not most, spontaneous processes are exothermic, there are also many spontaneous processes that are <em class="emphasis">not</em> exothermic. For example, at a pressure of 1 atm, ice melts spontaneously at temperatures greater than 0°C, yet this is an endothermic process because heat is absorbed. Similarly, many salts (such as NH<sub class="subscript">4</sub>NO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>, NaCl, and KBr) dissolve spontaneously in water even though they absorb heat from the surroundings as they dissolve (i.e., Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">soln</sub> &gt; 0). Reactions can also be both spontaneous and highly endothermic, like the reaction of barium hydroxide with ammonium thiocyanate shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch18_s03_f01">Figure 18.6 "An Endothermic Reaction"</a>.</p>
    <div class="figure large medium-height editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s03_f01">

        <img src="section_22/e114d8b906636e9d35e46b12b2d9118b.jpg">
        <p class="para">The reaction of barium hydroxide with ammonium thiocyanate is spontaneous but highly endothermic, so water, one product of the reaction, quickly freezes into slush. When water is placed on a block of wood under the flask, the highly endothermic reaction that takes place in the flask freezes water that has been placed under the beaker, so the flask becomes frozen to the wood.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s03_p05">Thus enthalpy is not the only factor that determines whether a process is spontaneous. For example, after a cube of sugar has dissolved in a glass of water so that the sucrose molecules are uniformly dispersed in a dilute solution, they never spontaneously come back together in solution to form a sugar cube. Moreover, the molecules of a gas remain evenly distributed throughout the entire volume of a glass bulb and never spontaneously assemble in only one portion of the available volume. To help explain why these phenomena proceed spontaneously in only one direction requires an additional state function called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">entropy (<em class="emphasis">S</em>)</a><span class="glossdef">The degree of disorder in a thermodynamic system, which is directly proportional to the possible number of microstates.</span></span>, a thermodynamic property of all substances that is proportional to their degree of disorder. In <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch13#averill_1.0-ch13">Chapter 13 "Solutions"</a>, we introduced the concept of entropy in relation to solution formation. Here we further explore the nature of this state function and define it mathematically.</p>
    <div class="section" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Entropy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p01">Chemical and physical changes in a system may be accompanied by either an increase or a decrease in the disorder of the system, corresponding to an increase in entropy (Δ<em class="emphasis">S</em> &gt; 0) or a decrease in entropy (Δ<em class="emphasis">S</em> &lt; 0), respectively. As with any other state function, the change in entropy is defined as the difference between the entropies of the final and initial states: Δ<em class="emphasis">S</em> = <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">f</sub> − <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">i</sub>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p02">When a gas expands into a vacuum, its entropy increases because the increased volume allows for greater atomic or molecular disorder. The greater the number of atoms or molecules in the gas, the greater the disorder. The magnitude of the entropy of a system depends on the number of microscopic states, or <em class="emphasis">microstates</em>, associated with it (in this case, the number of atoms or molecules); that is, the greater the number of microstates, the greater the entropy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p03">We can illustrate the concepts of microstates and entropy using a deck of playing cards, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_f01">Figure 18.7 "Illustrating Low- and High-Entropy States with a Deck of Playing Cards"</a>. In any new deck, the 52 cards are arranged by four suits, with each suit arranged in descending order. If the cards are shuffled, however, there are approximately 10<sup class="superscript">68</sup> different ways they might be arranged, which corresponds to 10<sup class="superscript">68</sup> different microscopic states. The entropy of an ordered new deck of cards is therefore low, whereas the entropy of a randomly shuffled deck is high. Card games assign a higher value to a hand that has a low degree of disorder. In games such as five-card poker, only 4 of the 2,598,960 different possible hands, or microstates, contain the highly ordered and valued arrangement of cards called a royal flush, almost 1.1 million hands contain one pair, and more than 1.3 million hands are completely disordered and therefore have no value. Because the last two arrangements are far more probable than the first, the value of a poker hand is inversely proportional to its entropy.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p04">We can see how to calculate these kinds of probabilities for a chemical system by considering the possible arrangements of a sample of four gas molecules in a two-bulb container (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_f02">Figure 18.8 "The Possible Microstates for a Sample of Four Gas Molecules in Two Bulbs of Equal Volume"</a>). There are five possible arrangements: all four molecules in the left bulb (I); three molecules in the left bulb and one in the right bulb (II); two molecules in each bulb (III); one molecule in the left bulb and three molecules in the right bulb (IV); and four molecules in the right bulb (V). If we assign a different color to each molecule to keep track of it for this discussion (remember, however, that in reality the molecules are indistinguishable from one another), we can see that there are 16 different ways the four molecules can be distributed in the bulbs, each corresponding to a particular microstate. As shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_f02">Figure 18.8 "The Possible Microstates for a Sample of Four Gas Molecules in Two Bulbs of Equal Volume"</a>, arrangement I is associated with a single microstate, as is arrangement V, so each arrangement has a probability of 1/16. Arrangements II and IV each have a probability of 4/16 because each can exist in four microstates. Similarly, six different microstates can occur as arrangement III, making the probability of this arrangement 6/16. Thus the arrangement that we would expect to encounter, with half the gas molecules in each bulb, is the <em class="emphasis">most probable</em> arrangement. The others are not impossible but simply less likely.</p>

            <p class="para">There are 16 different ways to distribute four gas molecules between the bulbs, with each distribution corresponding to a particular microstate.

It is the one encompassing the most microstates, so it is the most probable.</p>

        <p class="para block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p05">Instead of four molecules of gas, let’s now consider 1 L of an ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP), which contains 2.69 × 10<sup class="superscript">22</sup> molecules (6.022 × 10<sup class="superscript">23</sup> molecules/22.4 L). If we allow the sample of gas to expand into a second 1 L container, the probability of finding all 2.69 × 10<sup class="superscript">22</sup> molecules in one container and none in the other at any given time is extremely small, approximately <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="averill_1.0-18_m020" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>2.69</mn><mo>×</mo><msup><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>22</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mfrac><mtext>.</mtext></mrow></semantics></math></span> The probability of such an occurrence is effectively zero. Although nothing prevents the molecules in the gas sample from occupying only one of the two bulbs, that particular arrangement is so improbable that it is never actually observed. The probability of arrangements with essentially equal numbers of molecules in each bulb is quite high, however, because there are <em class="emphasis">many</em> equivalent microstates in which the molecules are distributed equally. Hence a macroscopic sample of a gas occupies all of the space available to it, simply because this is the most probable arrangement.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p06">A disordered system has a greater number of possible microstates than does an ordered system, so it has a higher entropy. This is most clearly seen in the entropy changes that accompany phase transitions, such as solid to liquid or liquid to gas. As you know from <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch11#averill_1.0-ch11">Chapter 11 "Liquids"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12#averill_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Solids"</a>, and <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch13#averill_1.0-ch13">Chapter 13 "Solutions"</a>, a crystalline solid is composed of an ordered array of molecules, ions, or atoms that occupy fixed positions in a lattice, whereas the molecules in a liquid are free to move and tumble within the volume of the liquid; molecules in a gas have even more freedom to move than those in a liquid. Each degree of motion increases the number of available microstates, resulting in a higher entropy. Thus the entropy of a system must increase during melting (Δ<em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">fus</sub> &gt; 0). Similarly, when a liquid is converted to a vapor, the greater freedom of motion of the molecules in the gas phase means that Δ<em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">vap</sub> &gt; 0. Conversely, the reverse processes (condensing a vapor to form a liquid or freezing a liquid to form a solid) must be accompanied by a decrease in the entropy of the system: Δ<em class="emphasis">S</em> &lt; 0.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_p08">Experiments show that the magnitude of Δ<em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">vap</sub> is 80–90 J/(mol·K) for a wide variety of liquids with different boiling points. However, liquids that have highly ordered structures due to hydrogen bonding or other intermolecular interactions tend to have significantly higher values of Δ<em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">vap</sub>. For instance, Δ<em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">vap</sub> for water is 102 J/(mol·K). Another process that is accompanied by entropy changes is the formation of a solution. As illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch18_s03_s01_f03">Figure 18.9 "The Effect of Solution Formation on Entropy"</a>, the formation of a liquid solution from a crystalline solid (the solute) and a liquid solvent is expected to result in an increase in the number of available microstates of the system and hence its entropy. Indeed, dissolving a substance such as NaCl in water disrupts both the ordered crystal lattice of NaCl and the ordered hydrogen-bonded structure of water, leading to an increase in the entropy of the system. At the same time, however, each dissolved Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ion becomes hydrated by an ordered arrangement of at least six water molecules, and the Cl<sup class="superscript">−</sup> ions also cause the water to adopt a particular local structure. Both of these effects <em class="emphasis">increase</em> the order of the system, leading to a <em class="emphasis">decrease</em> in entropy. The overall entropy change for the formation of a solution therefore depends on the relative magnitudes of these opposing factors. In the case of an NaCl solution, disruption of the crystalline NaCl structure and the hydrogen-bonded interactions in water is quantitatively more important, so Δ<em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">soln</sub> &gt; 0.</p>

When a gas expands reversibly against an external pressure such as a piston, for example, the expansion can be reversed at any time by reversing the motion of the piston; once the gas is compressed, it can be allowed to expand again, and the process can continue indefinitely. In contrast, the expansion of a gas into a vacuum (<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">ext</sub> = 0) is irreversible because the external pressure is measurably less than the internal pressure of the gas.

When an ice cube (the system, dark blue) is placed on the corner of a square sample of low-density carbon foam with very high thermal conductivity, the temperature of the foam is lowered (going from red to green). As the ice melts, a temperature gradient appears, ranging from warm to very cold. An arrow indicates the direction of heat flow from the surroundings (red and green) to the ice cube.

Gray tin (α-tin) has a structure similar to that of diamond, whereas white tin (β-tin) is denser, with a unit cell structure that is based on a rectangular prism. At temperatures greater than 13.2°C, white tin is the more stable phase, but below that temperature, it slowly converts reversibly to the less dense, powdery gray phase. This phenomenon plagued Napoleon’s army during his ill-fated invasion of Russia in 1812: the buttons on his soldiers’ uniforms were made of tin and disintegrated during the Russian winter, adversely affecting the soldiers’ health (and morale).

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s03_s03_p20">A measure of the disorder of a system is its <strong class="emphasis bold">entropy (</strong><em class="emphasis bolditalic">S</em><strong class="emphasis bold">)</strong>, a state function whose value increases with an increase in the number of available microstates. A <strong class="emphasis bold">reversible process</strong> is one for which all intermediate states between extremes are equilibrium states; it can change direction at any time. In contrast, an <strong class="emphasis bold">irreversible process</strong> occurs in one direction only. The change in entropy of the system or the surroundings is the quantity of heat transferred divided by the temperature. The <strong class="emphasis bold">second law of thermodynamics</strong> states that in a reversible process, the entropy of the universe is constant, whereas in an irreversible process, such as the transfer of heat from a hot object to a cold object, the entropy of the universe increases.</p>
