In fact, the magnitudes of the changes in both enthalpy and entropy for dissolution are temperature dependent. Because the solubility of a compound is ultimately determined by relatively small differences between large numbers, there is generally no good way to predict how the solubility will vary with temperature.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s04_s01_p03">The variation of solubility with temperature has been measured for a wide range of compounds, and the results are published in many standard reference books.

For example, if we have a mixture of 150 g of sodium acetate (CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Na) and 50 g of KBr, we can separate the two compounds by dissolving the mixture in 100 g of water at 80°C and then cooling the solution slowly to 0°C. According to the temperature curves in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch13_s04_s01_f01">Figure 13.9 "Solubilities of Several Inorganic and Organic Solids in Water as a Function of Temperature"</a>, both compounds dissolve in water at 80°C, and all 50 g of KBr remains in solution at 0°C. Only about 36 g of CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Na are soluble in 100 g of water at 0°C, however, so approximately 114 g (150 g − 36 g) of CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Na crystallizes out on cooling. The crystals can then be separated by filtration. Thus fractional crystallization allows us to recover about 75% of the original CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Na in essentially pure form in only one step.</p>

For the technique to work properly, the compound of interest must be more soluble at high temperature than at low temperature, so that lowering the temperature causes it to crystallize out of solution.

Attractive intermolecular interactions in the gas phase are essentially zero for most substances. When a gas dissolves, it does so because its molecules interact with solvent molecules. Because heat is released when these new attractive interactions form, dissolving most gases in liquids is an exothermic process (Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">soln</sub> &lt; 0). Conversely, adding heat to the solution provides thermal energy that overcomes the attractive forces between the gas and the solvent molecules, thereby decreasing the solubility of the gas.<span class="footnote" id="averill_1.0-fn13_001">The phenomenon is similar to that involved in the increase in vapor pressure of a pure liquid with increasing temperature, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch11#averill_1.0-ch11">Chapter 11 "Liquids"</a>.

Anyone who routinely boils water in a teapot or electric kettle knows that a white or gray deposit builds up on the inside and must eventually be removed. The same phenomenon occurs on a much larger scale in the giant boilers used to supply hot water or steam for industrial applications, where it is called “boiler scale,” a deposit that can seriously decrease the capacity of hot water pipes (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch13_s04_s02_f02">Figure 13.11 "Boiler Scale in a Water Pipe"</a>). The problem is not a uniquely modern one: aqueducts that were built by the Romans 2000 years ago to carry cold water from alpine regions to warmer, drier regions in southern France were clogged by similar deposits. The chemistry behind the formation of these deposits is moderately complex and will be described in more detail in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch17#averill_1.0-ch17">Chapter 17 "Solubility and Complexation Equilibriums"</a>, but the driving force is the loss of dissolved CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> from solution. Hard water contains dissolved Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> and HCO<sub class="subscript">3</sub><sup class="superscript">−</sup> (bicarbonate) ions. Calcium bicarbonate [Ca(HCO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>)<sub class="subscript">2</sub>] is rather soluble in water, but calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>) is quite insoluble.

Because of the reduced solubility of O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> at higher temperatures (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch13_s04_s02_f01">Figure 13.10 "Solubilities of Several Common Gases in Water as a Function of Temperature at Partial Pressure of 1 atm"</a>), the warmer water contains less dissolved oxygen than the water did when it entered the plant. Fish and other aquatic organisms that need dissolved oxygen to live can literally suffocate if the oxygen concentration of their habitat is too low. Because the warm, oxygen-depleted water is less dense, it tends to float on top of the cooler, denser, more oxygen-rich water in the lake or river, forming a barrier that prevents atmospheric oxygen from dissolving. Eventually even deep lakes can be suffocated if the problem is not corrected. Additionally, most fish and other nonmammalian aquatic organisms are cold-blooded, which means that their body temperature is the same as the temperature of their environment. Temperatures substantially greater than the normal range can lead to severe stress or even death. Cooling systems for power plants and other facilities must be designed to minimize any adverse effects on the temperatures of surrounding bodies of water.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s04_s02_p05">A similar effect is seen in the rising temperatures of bodies of water such as the Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in North America, where global warming has been implicated as the cause (For more information on global warming, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05#averill_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05_s05#averill_1.0-ch05_s05">Section 5.5 "Energy Sources and the Environment"</a>.) For each 1.5°C that the bay’s water warms, the capacity of water to dissolve oxygen decreases by about 1.1%. Many marine species that are at the southern limit of their distributions have shifted their populations farther north. In 2005, the eelgrass, which forms an important nursery habitat for fish and shellfish, disappeared from much of the bay following record high water temperatures. Presumably, decreased oxygen levels decreased populations of clams and other filter feeders, which then decreased light transmission to allow the eelsgrass to grow. The complex relationships in ecosystems such as the Chesapeake Bay are especially sensitive to temperature fluctuations that cause a deterioration of habitat quality.</p>

Because the concentration of molecules in the gas phase increases with increasing pressure, the concentration of dissolved gas molecules in the solution at equilibrium is also higher at higher pressures.</p>

            <p class="para">(a) When a gas comes in contact with a pure liquid, some of the gas molecules (purple spheres) collide with the surface of the liquid and dissolve. When the concentration of dissolved gas molecules has increased so that the rate at which gas molecules escape into the gas phase is the same as the rate at which they dissolve, a dynamic equilibrium has been established, as depicted here. This equilibrium is entirely analogous to the one that maintains the vapor pressure of a liquid. (For more information on vapor pressure, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch11#averill_1.0-ch11">Chapter 11 "Liquids"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch11_s03#averill_1.0-ch11_s03">Section 11.3 "Unique Properties of Liquids"</a>.) (b) Increasing the pressure of the gas increases the number of molecules of gas per unit volume, which increases the rate at which gas molecules collide with the surface of the liquid and dissolve.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s04_s03_p07">Henry’s law has important applications. For example, bubbles of CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> form as soon as a carbonated beverage is opened because the drink was bottled under CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> at a pressure greater than 1 atm. When the bottle is opened, the pressure of CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> above the solution drops rapidly, and some of the dissolved gas escapes from the solution as bubbles. Henry’s law also explains why scuba divers have to be careful to ascend to the surface slowly after a dive if they are breathing compressed air. At the higher pressures under water, more N<sub class="subscript">2</sub> from the air dissolves in the diver’s internal fluids. If the diver ascends too quickly, the rapid pressure change causes small bubbles of N<sub class="subscript">2</sub> to form throughout the body, a condition known as “the bends.” These bubbles can block the flow of blood through the small blood vessels, causing great pain and even proving fatal in some cases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s04_s03_p08">Due to the low Henry’s law constant for O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> in water, the levels of dissolved oxygen in water are too low to support the energy needs of multicellular organisms, including humans. To increase the O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> concentration in internal fluids, organisms synthesize highly soluble carrier molecules that bind O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> reversibly. For example, human red blood cells contain a protein called hemoglobin that specifically binds O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> and facilitates its transport from the lungs to the tissues, where it is used to oxidize food molecules to provide energy. The concentration of hemoglobin in normal blood is about 2.2 mM, and each hemoglobin molecule can bind four O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> molecules. Although the concentration of dissolved O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> in blood serum at 37°C (normal body temperature) is only 0.010 mM, the total dissolved O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> concentration is 8.8 mM, almost a thousand times greater than would be possible without hemoglobin. Synthetic oxygen carriers based on fluorinated alkanes have been developed for use as an emergency replacement for whole blood. Unlike donated blood, these “blood substitutes” do not require refrigeration and have a long shelf life. Their very high Henry’s law constants for O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> result in dissolved oxygen concentrations comparable to those in normal blood.</p>

                        <p class="para">Evacuating the flask to remove gases decreases the partial pressure of oxygen above the solution. According to Henry’s law, the solubility of any gas decreases as its partial pressure above the solution decreases. Consequently, dissolved oxygen escapes from solution into the gas phase, where it is removed by the vacuum pump. Filling the flask with nitrogen gas and repeating this process several times effectively removes almost all of the dissolved oxygen. The temperature of the solvent decreases because some solvent evaporates as well during this process.
