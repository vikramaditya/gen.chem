    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s05_p01">The ever-increasing energy needs of modern societies have led scientists and engineers to develop ways of harnessing the energy released by nuclear reactions. To date, all practical applications of nuclear power have been based on nuclear fission reactions. Although nuclear fusion offers many advantages in principle, technical difficulties in achieving the high energies required to initiate nuclear fusion reactions have thus far precluded using fusion for the controlled release of energy. In this section, we describe the various types of nuclear power plants that currently generate electricity from nuclear reactions, along with some possible ways to harness fusion energy in the future. In addition, we discuss some of the applications of nuclear radiation and radioisotopes, which have innumerable uses in medicine, biology, chemistry, and industry.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s01_p01">When a critical mass of a fissile isotope is achieved, the resulting flux of neutrons can lead to a self-sustaining reaction. A variety of techniques can be used to control the flow of neutrons from such a reaction, which allows nuclear fission reactions to be maintained at safe levels. Many levels of control are required, along with a fail-safe design, because otherwise the chain reaction can accelerate so rapidly that it releases enough heat to melt or vaporize the fuel and the container, a situation that can release enough radiation to contaminate the surrounding area. Uncontrolled nuclear fission reactions are relatively rare, but they have occurred at least 18 times in the past. The most recent event resulted from the damaged Fukushima Dai-ichi plant after the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami that devastated Japan. The plant used fresh water for cooling nuclear fuel rods to maintain controlled, sustainable nuclear fission. When the water supply was disrupted, so much heat was generated that a partial meltdown occurred. Radioactive iodine levels in contaminated seawater from the plant were over 4300 times the regulated safety limit. To put this in perspective, drinking one liter of fresh water with this level of contamination is the equivalent to receiving double the annual dose of radiation that is typical for a person. Dismantling the plant and decontaminating the site is estimated to require 30 years at a cost of approximately $12 billion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s01_p02">There is compelling evidence that uncontrolled nuclear chain reactions occurred naturally in the early history of our planet, about 1.7 billion years ago in uranium deposits near Oklo in Gabon, West Africa (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s01_f01">Figure 20.19 "A “Fossil Nuclear Reactor” in a Uranium Mine Near Oklo in Gabon, West Africa"</a>). The natural abundance of <sup class="superscript">235</sup>U 2 billion years ago was about 3%, compared with 0.72% today; in contrast, the “fossil nuclear reactor” deposits in Gabon now contain only 0.44% <sup class="superscript">235</sup>U. An unusual combination of geologic phenomena in this region apparently resulted in the formation of deposits of essentially pure uranium oxide containing 3% <sup class="superscript">235</sup>U, which coincidentally is identical to the fuel used in many modern nuclear plants. When rainwater or groundwater saturated one of these deposits, the water acted as a natural <em class="emphasis">moderator</em> that decreased the kinetic energy of the neutrons emitted by radioactive decay of <sup class="superscript">235</sup>U, allowing the neutrons to initiate a chain reaction. As a result, the entire deposit “went critical” and became an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction, which is estimated to have produced about 100 kW of power. It is thought that these natural nuclear reactors operated only intermittently, however, because the heat released would have vaporized the water. Removing the water would have shut down the reactor until the rocks cooled enough to allow water to reenter the deposit, at which point the chain reaction would begin again. This on–off cycle is believed to have been repeated for more than 100,000 years, until so much <sup class="superscript">235</sup>U was consumed that the deposits could no longer support a chain reaction.</p>

            <p class="para">More than a billion years ago, a number of uranium-rich deposits in West Africa apparently “went critical,” initiating uncontrolled nuclear fission reactions that may have continued intermittently for more than 100,000 years, until the concentration of uranium-235 became too low to support a chain reaction. This photo shows a geologist standing in a mine dug to extract the concentrated uranium ore. Commercial interest waned rapidly after it was recognized that the uranium ore was severely depleted in uranium-235, the isotope of interest.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s01_p03">In addition to the incident in Japan, another recent instance of an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction occurred on April 25–26, 1986, at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR; now in the Ukraine; <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s01_f02">Figure 20.20 "The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant"</a>). During testing of the reactor’s turbine generator, a series of mechanical and operational failures caused a chain reaction that quickly went out of control, destroying the reactor core and igniting a fire that destroyed much of the facility and released a large amount of radioactivity. Thirty people were killed immediately, and the high levels of radiation in a 20 mi radius forced nearly 350,000 people to be resettled or evacuated. In addition, the accident caused a disruption to the Soviet economy that is estimated to have cost almost $13 billion. It is somewhat surprising, however, that the long-term health effects on the 600,000 people affected by the accident appear to be much less severe than originally anticipated. Initially, it was predicted that the accident would result in tens of thousands of premature deaths, but an exhaustive study almost 20 yr after the event suggests that 4000 people will die prematurely from radiation exposure due to the accident. Although significant, in fact it represents only about a 3% increase in the cancer rate among the 600,000 people most affected, of whom about a quarter would be expected to eventually die of cancer even if the accident had not occurred.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s01_p04">If, on the other hand, the neutron flow in a reactor is carefully regulated so that only enough heat is released to boil water, then the resulting steam can be used to produce electricity. Thus a nuclear reactor is similar in many respects to the conventional power plants discussed in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05#averill_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions"</a>, which burn coal or natural gas to generate electricity; the only difference is the source of the heat that converts water to steam.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s01_s01_p01">We begin our description of nuclear power plants with light-water reactors, which are used extensively to produce electricity in countries such as Japan, Israel, South Korea, Taiwan, and France—countries that lack large reserves of fossil fuels.

All existing nuclear power plants have similar components, although different designs use different fuels and operating conditions. <em class="emphasis">Fuel rods</em> containing a fissile isotope in a structurally stabilized form (such as uranium oxide pellets encased in a corrosion-resistant zirconium alloy) are suspended in a cooling bath that transfers the heat generated by the fission reaction to a secondary cooling system.

In addition, <em class="emphasis">control rods</em> are used to absorb neutrons and thereby control the rate of the nuclear chain reaction. Control rods are made of a substance that efficiently absorbs neutrons, such as boron, cadmium, or, in nuclear submarines, hafnium.

Control rods that contain elements such as boron, cadmium, or hafnium, which are very effective at absorbing neutrons, are used to control the rate of the fission reaction. A heat exchanger is used to boil water in a secondary cooling system, creating steam to drive the turbine and produce electricity. The large hyperbolic cooling tower, which is the most visible portion of the facility, condenses the steam in the secondary cooling circuit; it is often located at some distance from the actual reactor.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s01_s01_p02">Despite this apparent simplicity, many technical hurdles must be overcome for nuclear power to be an efficient and safe source of energy. Uranium contains only 0.72% uranium-235, which is the only naturally occurring fissile isotope of uranium. Because this abundance is not enough to support a chain reaction, the uranium fuel must be at least partially enriched in <sup class="superscript">235</sup>U, to a concentration of about 3%, for it to be able to sustain a chain reaction. At this level of enrichment, a nuclear explosion is impossible; far higher levels of enrichment (greater than or equal to 90%) are required for military applications such as nuclear weapons or the nuclear reactors in submarines. Enrichment is accomplished by converting uranium oxide to UF<sub class="subscript">6</sub>, which is volatile and contains discrete UF<sub class="subscript">6</sub> molecules. Because <sup class="superscript">235</sup>UF<sub class="subscript">6</sub> and <sup class="superscript">238</sup>UF<sub class="subscript">6</sub> have different masses, they have different rates of effusion and diffusion, and they can be separated using a gas diffusion process, as described in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch10#averill_1.0-ch10">Chapter 10 "Gases"</a>. Another difficulty is that neutrons produced by nuclear fission are too energetic to be absorbed by neighboring nuclei, and they escape from the material without inducing fission in nearby <sup class="superscript">235</sup>U nuclei. Consequently, a moderator must be used to slow the neutrons enough to allow them to be captured by other <sup class="superscript">235</sup>U nuclei. High-speed neutrons are scattered by substances such as water or graphite, which decreases their kinetic energy and increases the probability that they will react with another <sup class="superscript">235</sup>U nucleus. The moderator in a light-water reactor is the water that is used as the primary coolant. The system is highly pressurized to about 100 atm to keep the water from boiling at 100°C.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s01_s01_p03">All nuclear reactors require a powerful cooling system to absorb the heat generated in the reactor core and create steam that is used to drive a turbine that generates electricity. In 1979, an accident occurred when the main water pumps used for cooling at the nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania stopped running, which prevented the steam generators from removing heat. Eventually, the zirconium casing of the fuel rods ruptured, resulting in a meltdown of about half of the reactor core. Although there was no loss of life and only a small release of radioactivity, the accident produced sweeping changes in nuclear power plant operations. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission tightened its oversight to improve safety.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s01_s01_p04">The main disadvantage of nuclear fission reactors is that the spent fuel, which contains too little of the fissile isotope for power generation, is much more radioactive than the unused fuel due to the presence of many daughter nuclei with shorter half-lives than <sup class="superscript">235</sup>U. The decay of these daughter isotopes generates so much heat that the spent fuel rods must be stored in water for as long as 5 yr before they can be handled. Even then, the radiation levels are so high that the rods must be stored for many, many more years to allow the daughter isotopes to decay to nonhazardous levels. How to store these spent fuel rods for hundreds of years is a pressing issue that has not yet been successfully resolved. As a result, some people are convinced that nuclear power is not a viable option for providing our future energy needs, although a number of other countries continue to rely on nuclear reactors for a large fraction of their energy.</p>

(As you learned in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch18#averill_1.0-ch18">Chapter 18 "Chemical Thermodynamics"</a>, thermodynamic spontaneity is unrelated to the reaction rate.) Extraordinarily high temperatures (about 1.0 × 10<sup class="superscript">8</sup>°C) are required to overcome electrostatic repulsions and initiate a fusion reaction. Even the most feasible such reaction, deuterium–tritium fusion (D–T fusion; <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch20_s04#averill_1.0-ch20_s04_s03_eq03" xrefstyle="select:label">Equation 20.39</a>), requires a temperature of about 4.0 × 10<sup class="superscript">7</sup>°C. Achieving these temperatures and controlling the materials to be fused are extraordinarily difficult problems, as is extracting the energy released by the fusion reaction, because a commercial fusion reactor would require such high temperatures to be maintained for long periods of time. Several different technologies are currently being explored, including the use of intense magnetic fields to contain ions in the form of a dense, high-energy plasma at a temperature high enough to sustain fusion (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s01_s04_f01">Figure 20.22 "Two Possible Designs for a Nuclear Fusion Reactor"</a>).

                <p class="para">The extraordinarily high temperatures needed to initiate a nuclear fusion reaction would immediately destroy a container made of any known material. (a) One way to avoid contact with the container walls is to use a high-energy plasma as the fuel. Because plasma is essentially a gas composed of ionized particles, it can be confined using a strong magnetic field shaped like a torus (a hollow donut). (b) Another approach to nuclear fusion is inertial confinement, which uses an icosahedral array of powerful lasers to heat and compress a tiny fuel pellet (a mixture of solid LiD and LiT) to induce fusion.</p>

The amount of energy released by the reaction, however, is several orders of magnitude greater than the energy needed to initiate it. In principle, a nuclear fusion reaction should thus result in a significant net production of energy. In addition, Earth’s oceans contain an essentially inexhaustible supply of both deuterium and tritium, which suggests that nuclear fusion could provide a limitless supply of energy. Unfortunately, however, the technical requirements for a successful nuclear fusion reaction are so great that net power generation by controlled fusion has yet to be achieved.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Uses of Radioisotopes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s02_p01">Nuclear radiation can damage biological molecules, thereby disrupting normal functions such as cell division (<a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch20_s03#averill_1.0-ch20_s03_s05_t01">Table 20.4 "The Effects of a Single Radiation Dose on a 70 kg Human"</a>). Because radiation is particularly destructive to rapidly dividing cells such as tumor cells and bacteria, it has been used medically to treat cancer since 1904, when radium-226 was first used to treat a cancerous tumor. Many radioisotopes are now available for medical use, and each has specific advantages for certain applications.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s02_p02">In modern <em class="emphasis">radiation therapy</em>, radiation is often delivered by a source planted inside the body. For example, tiny capsules containing an isotope such as <sup class="superscript">192</sup>Ir, coated with a thin layer of chemically inert platinum, are inserted into the middle of a tumor that cannot be removed surgically. The capsules are removed when the treatment is over. In some cases, physicians take advantage of the body’s own chemistry to deliver a radioisotope to the desired location. For example, the thyroid glands in the lower front of the neck are the only organs in the body that use iodine. Consequently, radioactive iodine is taken up almost exclusively by the thyroid (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s02_f01">Figure 20.23 "Medical Imaging and Treatment with Radioisotopes"</a>). Thus when radioactive isotopes of iodine (<sup class="superscript">125</sup>I or <sup class="superscript">131</sup>I) are injected into the blood of a patient suffering from thyroid cancer, the thyroid glands filter the radioisotope from the blood and concentrate it in the tissue to be destroyed. In cases where a tumor is surgically inaccessible (e.g., when it is located deep in the brain), an external radiation source such as a <sup class="superscript">60</sup>Co “gun” is used to aim a tightly focused beam of γ rays at it. Unfortunately, radiation therapy damages healthy tissue in addition to the target tumor and results in severe side effects, such as nausea, hair loss, and a weakened immune system. Although radiation therapy is generally not a pleasant experience, in many cases it is the only choice.</p>

            <p class="para">(a) Radioactive iodine is used both to obtain images of the thyroid and to treat thyroid cancer. Injected iodine-123 or iodine-131 is selectively taken up by the thyroid gland, where it is incorporated into the thyroid hormone: thyroxine. Because iodine-131 emits low-energy β particles that are absorbed by the surrounding tissue, it can be used to destroy malignant tissue in the thyroid. In contrast, iodine-123 emits higher-energy γ rays that penetrate tissues readily, enabling it to image the thyroid gland, as shown here. (b) Some technetium compounds are selectively absorbed by cancerous cells within bones. The yellow spots show that a primary cancer has metastasized (spread) to the patient’s spine (lower center) and ribs (right center).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s02_p07">One of the more unusual effects of radioisotopes is in dentistry. Because dental enamels contain a mineral called feldspar (KAlSi<sub class="subscript">3</sub>O<sub class="subscript">8</sub>, which is also found in granite rocks), teeth contain a small amount of naturally occurring radioactive <sup class="superscript">40</sup>K. The radiation caused by the decay of <sup class="superscript">40</sup>K results in the emission of light (<em class="emphasis">fluorescence</em>), which gives the highly desired “pearly white” appearance associated with healthy teeth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s02_p08">In a sign of how important nuclear medicine has become in diagnosing and treating illnesses, the medical community has become alarmed at the global shortage of <sup class="superscript">99</sup>Tc, a radioisotope used in more than 30 million procedures a year worldwide. Two reactors that produce 60% of the world’s radioactive <sup class="superscript">99</sup>Mo, which decays to <sup class="superscript">99</sup>Tc, are operating beyond their intended life expectancies. Moreover, because most of the reactors producing <sup class="superscript">99</sup>Mo use weapons-grade uranium (<sup class="superscript">235</sup>U), which decays to <sup class="superscript">99</sup>Mo during fission, governments are working to phase out civilian uses of technology to produce <sup class="superscript">99</sup>Mo because of concerns that the technology can be used to produce nuclear weapons. Engineers are currently focused on how to make key medical isotopes with other alternatives that don’t require fission. One promising option is by removing a neutron from <sup class="superscript">100</sup>Mo, a stable isotope that makes up about 10% of natural molybdenum, transmuting it to <sup class="superscript">99</sup>Mo.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s02_p09">In addition to the medical uses of radioisotopes, radioisotopes have literally hundreds of other uses. For example, smoke detectors contain a tiny amount of <sup class="superscript">241</sup>Am, which ionizes the air in the detector so an electric current can flow through it. Smoke particles reduce the number of ionized particles and decrease the electric current, which triggers an alarm. Another application is the “go-devil” used to detect leaks in long pipelines. It is a packaged radiation detector that is inserted into a pipeline and propelled through the pipe by the flowing liquid. Sources of <sup class="superscript">60</sup>Co are attached to the pipe at regular intervals; as the detector travels along the pipeline, it sends a radio signal each time it passes a source. When a massive leak causes the go-devil to stop, the repair crews know immediately which section of the pipeline is damaged. Finally, radioactive substances are used in gauges that measure and control the thickness of sheets and films. As shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch20_s05_s02_f03">Figure 20.25 "Using Radiation to Control the Thickness of a Material"</a>, thickness gauges rely on the absorption of either β particles (by paper, plastic, and very thin metal foils) or γ rays (for thicker metal sheets); the amount of radiation absorbed can be measured accurately and is directly proportional to the thickness of the material.</p>

            <p class="para">Because the amount of radiation absorbed by a material is proportional to its thickness, radiation can be used to control the thickness of plastic film, tin foil, or paper. As shown, a beta emitter is placed on one side of the material being produced and a detector on the other. An increase in the amount of radiation that reaches the detector indicates a decrease in the thickness of the material and vice versa. The output of the detector can thus be used to control the thickness of the material.</p>

                        <p class="para">Palladium-103, which decays via electron capture and emits x-rays with an energy of 3.97 × 10<sup class="superscript">−2</sup> MeV, is often used to treat prostate cancer. Small pellets of the radioactive metal are embedded in the prostate gland. This provides a localized source of radiation to a very small area, even though the tissue absorbs only about 1% of the x-rays. Due to its short half-life, all of the palladium will decay to a stable isotope in less than a year. If a doctor embeds 50 pellets containing 2.50 mg of <sup class="superscript">103</sup>Pd in the prostate gland of a 73.9 kg patient, what is the patient’s radiation exposure over the course of a year?</p>
