    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s01_p01">We begin our discussion of thermodynamics by reviewing some important terms introduced in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05#averill_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions"</a>. First, we need to distinguish between a system and its surroundings. A <strong class="emphasis bold">system</strong> is that part of the universe in which we are interested, such as a mixture of gases in a glass bulb or a solution of substances in a flask. The <strong class="emphasis bold">surroundings</strong> are everything else—the rest of the <em class="emphasis">universe</em>. We can therefore state the following:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s01_p02">A <strong class="emphasis bold">closed system</strong>, such as the contents of a sealed jar, cannot exchange matter with its surroundings, whereas an <strong class="emphasis bold">open system</strong> can; in this case, we can convert a closed system (the jar) to an open system by removing the jar’s lid.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s01_p03">In <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05#averill_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions"</a>, we also introduced the concept of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">state function</a><span class="glossdef">A property of a system whose magnitude depends on only the present state of the system, not its previous history.</span></span>, a property of a system that depends on only the present state of the system, not its history. Thus a change in a state function depends on only the difference between the initial and final states, not the pathway used to go from one to the other. To help understand the concept of a state function, imagine a person hiking up a mountain (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch18_s01_f01">Figure 18.1 "Altitude Is a State Function"</a>). If the person is well trained and fit, he or she may be able to climb almost vertically to the top (path A), whereas another less athletic person may choose a path that winds gradually to the top (path B). If both hikers start from the same point at the base of the mountain and end up at the same point at the top, their <em class="emphasis">net change in altitude</em> will be the same regardless of the path chosen. Hence altitude is a state function. On the other hand, a person may or may not carry a heavy pack and may climb in hot weather or cold. These conditions would influence changes in the hiker’s fatigue level, which depends on the path taken and the conditions experienced. Fatigue, therefore, is not a state function. Thermodynamics is generally concerned with state functions and does not deal with how the change between the initial state and final state occurs.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s01_s01_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">internal energy (<em class="emphasis">E</em>)</a><span class="glossdef">A state function that is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of all a system’s components.</span></span> of a system is the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy of all the components; internal energy is a state function. Although a closed system cannot exchange matter with its surroundings, it can exchange energy with its surroundings in two ways: by doing work or by releasing or absorbing heat—the flow of thermal energy. Work and heat are therefore two distinct ways of changing the internal energy of a system. We defined <em class="emphasis">work</em> (<em class="emphasis">w</em>) in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05#averill_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions"</a> as a force <em class="emphasis">F</em> acting through a distance <em class="emphasis">d</em>:</p>

                </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s01_s01_p02">Because work occurs only when an object, such as a person, or a substance, such as water, moves against an opposing force, work requires that a system and its surroundings be connected. In contrast, the flow of <em class="emphasis">heat</em>, the transfer of energy due to differences in temperature between two objects, represents a thermal connection between a system and its surroundings. Thus doing work causes a physical displacement, whereas the flow of heat causes a temperature change. The units of work and heat must be the same because both processes result in the transfer of energy. In the SI system, those units are joules (J), the same unit used for energy. There is no difference between an energy change brought about by doing work on a system and an equal energy change brought about by heating it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s01_s01_p03">The connections among work, heat, and energy were first described by Benjamin Thompson (1753–1814), an American-born scientist who was also known as Count Rumford. While supervising the manufacture of cannons, Rumford recognized the relationship between the amount of work required to drill out a cannon and the temperature of the water used to cool it during the drilling process (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch18_s01_s01_f01">Figure 18.2 "The Relationship between Heat and Work"</a>). At that time, it was generally thought that heat and work were separate and unrelated phenomena. Hence Rumford’s ideas were not widely accepted until many years later, after his findings had been corroborated in other laboratories.</p>

            <p class="para">In the 1780s, an American scientist named Benjamin Thompson, also known as Count Rumford, was hired by the Elector of Bavaria to supervise the manufacture of cannons. During the manufacturing process, teams of horses harnessed to a large-toothed wheel supplied the power needed to drill a hole several inches in diameter straight down the center of a solid brass or bronze cylinder, which was cooled by water. Based on his observations, Rumford became convinced that heat and work are equivalent ways of transferring energy.</p>

<em class="emphasis">PV</em> Work</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s01_s02_p01">As we saw in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05#averill_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions"</a>, there are many kinds of work, including mechanical work, electrical work, and work against a gravitational or a magnetic field. Here we will consider only mechanical work, focusing on the work done during changes in the pressure or the volume of a gas. To describe this <em class="emphasis">pressure–volume work</em> (<em class="emphasis">PV</em> work), we will use such imaginary oddities as frictionless pistons, which involve no component of resistance, and ideal gases, which have no attractive or repulsive interactions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch18_s01_s02_p02">Imagine, for example, an ideal gas, confined by a frictionless piston, with internal pressure <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">int</sub> and initial volume <em class="emphasis">V</em><sub class="subscript">i</sub> (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch18_s01_s02_f01">Figure 18.3</a>). If <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">ext</sub> = <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">int</sub>, the system is at equilibrium; the piston does not move, and no work is done. If the external pressure on the piston (<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">ext</sub>) is less than <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">int</sub>, however, then the ideal gas inside the piston will expand, forcing the piston to perform work on its surroundings; that is, the final volume (<em class="emphasis">V</em><sub class="subscript">f</sub>) will be greater than <em class="emphasis">V</em><sub class="subscript">i</sub>. If <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">ext</sub> &gt; <em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">int</sub>, then the gas will be compressed, and the surroundings will perform work on the system.</p>
