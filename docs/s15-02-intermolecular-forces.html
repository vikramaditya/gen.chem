In contrast to <em class="emphasis">intra</em>molecular forces, such as the covalent bonds that hold atoms together in molecules and polyatomic ions, <em class="emphasis">inter</em>molecular forces hold molecules together in a liquid or solid. Intermolecular forces are generally much weaker than covalent bonds. For example, it requires 927 kJ to overcome the intramolecular forces and break both O–H bonds in 1 mol of water, but it takes only about 41 kJ to overcome the intermolecular attractions and convert 1 mol of liquid water to water vapor at 100°C. (Despite this seemingly low value, the intermolecular forces in liquid water are among the strongest such forces known!) Given the large difference in the strengths of intra- and intermolecular forces, changes between the solid, liquid, and gaseous states almost invariably occur for molecular substances <em class="emphasis">without breaking covalent bonds</em>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s02_p03">Intermolecular forces determine bulk properties such as the melting points of solids and the boiling points of liquids. Liquids boil when the molecules have enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular attractive forces that hold them together, thereby forming bubbles of vapor within the liquid. Similarly, solids melt when the molecules acquire enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that lock them into place in the solid.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s02_p04">Intermolecular forces are electrostatic in nature; that is, they arise from the interaction between positively and negatively charged species. Like covalent and ionic bonds, intermolecular interactions are the sum of both attractive and repulsive components. Because electrostatic interactions fall off rapidly with increasing distance between molecules, intermolecular interactions are most important for solids and liquids, where the molecules are close together. These interactions become important for gases only at very high pressures, where they are responsible for the observed deviations from the ideal gas law at high pressures. (For more information on the behavior of real gases and deviations from the ideal gas law, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch10#averill_1.0-ch10">Chapter 10 "Gases"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch10_s08#averill_1.0-ch10_s08">Section 10.8 "The Behavior of Real Gases"</a>.)</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_p01">Recall from <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch09#averill_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Molecular Geometry and Covalent Bonding Models"</a> that polar covalent bonds behave as if the bonded atoms have localized fractional charges that are equal but opposite (i.e., the two bonded atoms generate a <em class="emphasis">dipole</em>). If the structure of a molecule is such that the individual bond dipoles do not cancel one another, then the molecule has a net dipole moment. Molecules with net dipole moments tend to align themselves so that the positive end of one dipole is near the negative end of another and vice versa, as shown in part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_f01">Figure 11.3 "Attractive and Repulsive Dipole–Dipole Interactions"</a>. These arrangements are more stable than arrangements in which two positive or two negative ends are adjacent (part (c) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_f01">Figure 11.3 "Attractive and Repulsive Dipole–Dipole Interactions"</a>).

Because molecules in a liquid move freely and continuously, molecules always experience both attractive and repulsive dipole–dipole interactions simultaneously, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_f02">Figure 11.4 "Both Attractive and Repulsive Dipole–Dipole Interactions Occur in a Liquid Sample with Many Molecules"</a>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_p02">Because each end of a dipole possesses only a fraction of the charge of an electron, dipole–dipole interactions are substantially weaker than the interactions between two ions, each of which has a charge of at least ±1, or between a dipole and an ion, in which one of the species has at least a full positive or negative charge. In addition, the attractive interaction between dipoles falls off much more rapidly with increasing distance than do the ion–ion interactions we considered in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch08#averill_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Ionic versus Covalent Bonding"</a>. Recall that the attractive energy between two ions is proportional to 1/<em class="emphasis">r</em>, where <em class="emphasis">r</em> is the distance between the ions. Doubling the distance (<em class="emphasis">r</em> → 2<em class="emphasis">r</em>) decreases the attractive energy by one-half. In contrast, the energy of the interaction of two dipoles is proportional to 1/<em class="emphasis">r</em><sup class="superscript">6</sup>, so doubling the distance between the dipoles decreases the strength of the interaction by 2<sup class="superscript">6</sup>, or 64-fold. Thus a substance such as HCl, which is partially held together by dipole–dipole interactions, is a gas at room temperature and 1 atm pressure, whereas NaCl, which is held together by interionic interactions, is a high-melting-point solid. Within a series of compounds of similar molar mass, the strength of the intermolecular interactions increases as the dipole moment of the molecules increases, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_t01">Table 11.2 "Relationships between the Dipole Moment and the Boiling Point for Organic Compounds of Similar Molar Mass"</a>. Using what we learned in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch09#averill_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Molecular Geometry and Covalent Bonding Models"</a> about predicting relative bond polarities from the electronegativities of the bonded atoms, we can make educated guesses about the relative boiling points of similar molecules.</p>

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_p10">The three compounds have essentially the same molar mass (58–60 g/mol), so we must look at differences in polarity to predict the strength of the intermolecular dipole–dipole interactions and thus the boiling points of the compounds. The first compound, 2-methylpropane, contains only C–H bonds, which are not very polar because C and H have similar electronegativities. It should therefore have a very small (but nonzero) dipole moment and a very low boiling point. Ethyl methyl ether has a structure similar to H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O; it contains two polar C–O single bonds oriented at about a 109° angle to each other, in addition to relatively nonpolar C–H bonds. As a result, the C–O bond dipoles partially reinforce one another and generate a significant dipole moment that should give a moderately high boiling point. Acetone contains a polar C=O double bond oriented at about 120° to two methyl groups with nonpolar C–H bonds. The C–O bond dipole therefore corresponds to the molecular dipole, which should result in both a rather large dipole moment and a high boiling point. Thus we predict the following order of boiling points: 2-methylpropane &lt; ethyl methyl ether &lt; acetone. This result is in good agreement with the actual data: 2-methylpropane, boiling point = −11.7°C, and the dipole moment (μ) = 0.13 D; methyl ethyl ether, boiling point = 7.4°C and μ = 1.17 D; acetone, boiling point = 56.1°C and μ = 2.88 D.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_p03">Consider a pair of adjacent He atoms, for example. On average, the two electrons in each He atom are uniformly distributed around the nucleus. Because the electrons are in constant motion, however, their distribution in one atom is likely to be asymmetrical at any given instant, resulting in an instantaneous dipole moment. As shown in part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_f01">Figure 11.5 "Instantaneous Dipole Moments"</a>, the instantaneous dipole moment on one atom can interact with the electrons in an adjacent atom, pulling them toward the positive end of the instantaneous dipole or repelling them from the negative end. The net effect is that the first atom causes the temporary formation of a dipole, called an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">induced dipole</a><span class="glossdef">A short-lived dipole moment that is created in atoms and nonpolar molecules adjacent to atoms or molecules with an instantaneous dipole moment.</span></span>, in the second. Interactions between these temporary dipoles cause atoms to be attracted to one another. These attractive interactions are weak and fall off rapidly with increasing distance. London was able to show with quantum mechanics that the attractive energy between molecules due to temporary dipole–induced dipole interactions falls off as 1/<em class="emphasis">r</em><sup class="superscript">6</sup>. Doubling the distance therefore decreases the attractive energy by 2<sup class="superscript">6</sup>, or 64-fold.</p>

This effect, illustrated for two H<sub class="subscript">2</sub> molecules in part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_f01">Figure 11.5 "Instantaneous Dipole Moments"</a>, tends to become more pronounced as atomic and molecular masses increase (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_t01">Table 11.3 "Normal Melting and Boiling Points of Some Elements and Nonpolar Compounds"</a>). For example, Xe boils at −108.1°C, whereas He boils at −269°C. The reason for this trend is that the strength of London dispersion forces is related to the ease with which the electron distribution in a given atom can be perturbed. In small atoms such as He, the two 1<em class="emphasis">s</em> electrons are held close to the nucleus in a very small volume, and electron–electron repulsions are strong enough to prevent significant asymmetry in their distribution. In larger atoms such as Xe, however, the outer electrons are much less strongly attracted to the nucleus because of filled intervening shells. (For more information on shielding, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch07#averill_1.0-ch07">Chapter 7 "The Periodic Table and Periodic Trends"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch07_s02#averill_1.0-ch07_s02">Section 7.2 "Sizes of Atoms and Ions"</a>.) As a result, it is relatively easy to temporarily deform the electron distribution to generate an instantaneous or induced dipole. The ease of deformation of the electron distribution in an atom or molecule is called its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">polarizability</a><span class="glossdef">The ease of deformation of the electron distribution in an atom or molecule.</span></span>. Because the electron distribution is more easily perturbed in large, heavy species than in small, light species, we say that heavier substances tend to be much more <em class="emphasis">polarizable</em> than lighter ones.</p>

The answer lies in the highly polar nature of the bonds between hydrogen and very electronegative elements such as O, N, and F. The large difference in electronegativity results in a large partial positive charge on hydrogen and a correspondingly large partial negative charge on the O, N, or F atom. Consequently, H–O, H–N, and H–F bonds have very large bond dipoles that can interact strongly with one another. Because a hydrogen atom is so small, these dipoles can also approach one another more closely than most other dipoles. The combination of large bond dipoles and short dipole–dipole distances results in very strong dipole–dipole interactions called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hydrogen bonds</a><span class="glossdef">An unusually strong dipole-dipole interaction (intermolecular force) that results when hydrogen is bonded to very electronegative elements, such as O, N, and F.</span></span>, as shown for ice in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_f02">Figure 11.8 "The Hydrogen-Bonded Structure of Ice"</a>.

Because each water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs, a tetrahedral arrangement maximizes the number of hydrogen bonds that can be formed. In the structure of ice, each oxygen atom is surrounded by a distorted tetrahedron of hydrogen atoms that form bridges to the oxygen atoms of adjacent water molecules. The bridging hydrogen atoms are <em class="emphasis">not</em> equidistant from the two oxygen atoms they connect, however. Instead, each hydrogen atom is 101 pm from one oxygen and 174 pm from the other. In contrast, each oxygen atom is bonded to two H atoms at the shorter distance and two at the longer distance, corresponding to two O–H covalent bonds and two <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="averill_1.0-ch11_m001" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mtext>O</mtext><mo>⋅</mo><mo>⋅</mo><mo>⋅</mo><mtext>H</mtext></mrow></semantics></math></span> hydrogen bonds from adjacent water molecules, respectively.

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_p26">Molecules in liquids are held to other molecules by intermolecular interactions, which are weaker than the intramolecular interactions that hold the atoms together within molecules and polyatomic ions. Transitions between the solid and liquid or the liquid and gas phases are due to changes in intermolecular interactions but do not affect intramolecular interactions. The three major types of intermolecular interactions are dipole–dipole interactions, London dispersion forces (these two are often referred to collectively as <strong class="emphasis bold">van der Waals forces</strong>), and hydrogen bonds. <strong class="emphasis bold">Dipole–dipole interactions</strong> arise from the electrostatic interactions of the positive and negative ends of molecules with permanent dipole moments; their strength is proportional to the magnitude of the dipole moment and to 1/<em class="emphasis">r</em><sup class="superscript">6</sup>, where <em class="emphasis">r</em> is the distance between dipoles. <strong class="emphasis bold">London dispersion forces</strong> are due to the formation of <strong class="emphasis bold">instantaneous dipole moments</strong> in polar or nonpolar molecules as a result of short-lived fluctuations of electron charge distribution, which in turn cause the temporary formation of an <strong class="emphasis bold">induced dipole</strong> in adjacent molecules. Like dipole–dipole interactions, their energy falls off as 1/<em class="emphasis">r</em><sup class="superscript">6</sup>. Larger atoms tend to be more <strong class="emphasis bold">polarizable</strong> than smaller ones because their outer electrons are less tightly bound and are therefore more easily perturbed. <strong class="emphasis bold">Hydrogen bonds</strong> are especially strong dipole–dipole interactions between molecules that have hydrogen bonded to a highly electronegative atom, such as O, N, or F. The resulting partially positively charged H atom on one molecule (the <em class="emphasis">hydrogen bond donor</em>) can interact strongly with a lone pair of electrons of a partially negatively charged O, N, or F atom on adjacent molecules (the <em class="emphasis">hydrogen bond acceptor</em>). Because of strong <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="averill_1.0-ch11_m002" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mtext>O</mtext><mo>⋅</mo><mo>⋅</mo><mo>⋅</mo><mtext>H</mtext></mrow></semantics></math></span> hydrogen bonding between water molecules, water has an unusually high boiling point, and ice has an open, cagelike structure that is less dense than liquid water.</p>
