<span class="title-prefix">Chapter 12</span> Solids</h1>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_p01">In this chapter, we turn our attention to the structures and properties of solids. The solid state is distinguished from the gas and liquid states by a rigid structure in which the component atoms, ions, or molecules are usually locked into place. In many solids, the components are arranged in extended three-dimensional patterns, producing a wide range of properties that can often be tailored to specific functions. Thus diamond, an allotrope of elemental carbon, is one of the hardest materials known, yet graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is a soft, slippery material used in pencil lead and as a lubricant. Metallic sodium is soft enough to be cut with a dull knife, but crystalline sodium chloride turns into a fine powder when struck with a hammer.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_p02">Solids, also called <em class="emphasis">materials</em>, are so important in today’s technology that the subdisciplines of solid-state chemistry and materials science are among the most active and exciting areas of modern chemical research. After presenting a basic survey of the structures of solids, we will examine how the properties of solids are determined by their composition and structure. We will also explore the principles underlying the electrical properties of metals, insulators, semiconductors (which are at the heart of the modern electronics industry), and superconductors. By the end of the chapter, you will know why some metals “remember” their shape after being bent and why ceramics are used in jet engines. You will also understand why carbon- or boron-fiber materials are used in high-performance golf clubs and tennis rackets, why nylon is used to make parachutes, and how solid electrolytes improve the performance of high-capacity batteries.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s01_p01">With few exceptions, the particles that compose a solid material, whether ionic, molecular, covalent, or metallic, are held in place by strong attractive forces between them. When we discuss solids, therefore, we consider the <em class="emphasis">positions</em> of the atoms, molecules, or ions, which are essentially fixed in space, rather than their motions (which are more important in liquids and gases). The constituents of a solid can be arranged in two general ways: they can form a regular repeating three-dimensional structure called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">crystal lattice</a><span class="glossdef">A regular repeating three-dimensional structure.</span></span>, thus producing a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">crystalline solid</a><span class="glossdef">A solid with a regular repeating three-dimensional structure.</span></span>, or they can aggregate with no particular order, in which case they form an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">amorphous solid</a><span class="glossdef">A solid with no particular structural order.</span></span> (from the Greek <em class="emphasis">ámorphos</em>, meaning “shapeless”).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s01_p02">Crystalline solids, or <em class="emphasis">crystals</em>, have distinctive internal structures that in turn lead to distinctive flat surfaces, or <em class="emphasis">faces</em>. The faces intersect at angles that are characteristic of the substance. When exposed to x-rays, each structure also produces a distinctive pattern that can be used to identify the material (see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12_s03#averill_1.0-ch12_s03">Section 12.3 "Structures of Simple Binary Compounds"</a>). The characteristic angles do not depend on the size of the crystal; they reflect the regular repeating arrangement of the component atoms, molecules, or ions in space. When an ionic crystal is cleaved (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s01_f01">Figure 12.1 "Cleaving a Crystal of an Ionic Compound along a Plane of Ions"</a>), for example, repulsive interactions cause it to break along fixed planes to produce new faces that intersect at the same angles as those in the original crystal. In a covalent solid such as a cut diamond, the angles at which the faces meet are also not arbitrary but are determined by the arrangement of the carbon atoms in the crystal.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s01_p03">Crystals tend to have relatively sharp, well-defined melting points because all the component atoms, molecules, or ions are the same distance from the same number and type of neighbors; that is, the regularity of the crystalline lattice creates local environments that are the same. Thus the intermolecular forces holding the solid together are uniform, and the same amount of thermal energy is needed to break every interaction simultaneously.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s01_p04">Amorphous solids have two characteristic properties. When cleaved or broken, they produce fragments with irregular, often curved surfaces; and they have poorly defined patterns when exposed to x-rays because their components are not arranged in a regular array. An amorphous, translucent solid is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">glass</a><span class="glossdef">An amorphous, translucent solid. A glass is a solid that has been cooled too quickly to form ordered crystals.</span></span>. Almost any substance can solidify in amorphous form if the liquid phase is cooled rapidly enough. Some solids, however, are intrinsically amorphous, because either their components cannot fit together well enough to form a stable crystalline lattice or they contain impurities that disrupt the lattice. For example, although the chemical composition and the basic structural units of a quartz crystal and quartz glass are the same—both are SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> and both consist of linked SiO<sub class="subscript">4</sub> tetrahedra—the arrangements of the atoms in space are not. Crystalline quartz contains a highly ordered arrangement of silicon and oxygen atoms, but in quartz glass the atoms are arranged almost randomly. When molten SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> is cooled rapidly (4 K/min), it forms quartz glass, whereas the large, perfect quartz crystals sold in mineral shops have had cooling times of thousands of years. In contrast, aluminum crystallizes much more rapidly. Amorphous aluminum forms only when the liquid is cooled at the extraordinary rate of 4 × 10<sup class="superscript">13</sup> K/s, which prevents the atoms from arranging themselves into a regular array.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s01_p05">In an amorphous solid, the local environment, including both the distances to neighboring units and the numbers of neighbors, varies throughout the material. Different amounts of thermal energy are needed to overcome these different interactions. Consequently, amorphous solids tend to soften slowly over a wide temperature range rather than having a well-defined melting point like a crystalline solid. If an amorphous solid is maintained at a temperature just below its melting point for long periods of time, the component molecules, atoms, or ions can gradually rearrange into a more highly ordered crystalline form.</p>

Usually the smallest unit cell that completely describes the order is chosen. The only requirement for a valid unit cell is that repeating it in space must produce the regular lattice. Thus the unit cell in part (d) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s02_f01">Figure 12.2 "Unit Cells in Two Dimensions"</a> is not a valid choice because repeating it in space does not produce the desired lattice (there are triangular holes).

Each atom in the lattice has only six nearest neighbors in an octahedral arrangement. Consequently, the simple cubic lattice is an inefficient way to pack atoms together in space: only 52% of the total space is filled by the atoms. The only element that crystallizes in a simple cubic unit cell is polonium. Simple cubic unit cells are, however, common among binary ionic compounds, where each cation is surrounded by six anions and vice versa.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s03_p01">The structures of most binary compounds can be described using the packing schemes we have just discussed for metals. To do so, we generally focus on the arrangement in space of the largest species present. In ionic solids, this generally means the anions, which are usually arranged in a simple cubic, bcc, fcc, or hcp lattice. (For more information about anions, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch07#averill_1.0-ch07">Chapter 7 "The Periodic Table and Periodic Trends"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch07_s02#averill_1.0-ch07_s02">Section 7.2 "Sizes of Atoms and Ions"</a>.) Often, however, the anion lattices are not truly “close packed”; because the cations are large enough to prop them apart somewhat, the anions are not actually in contact with one another. In ionic compounds, the cations usually occupy the “holes” between the anions, thus balancing the negative charge. The ratio of cations to anions within a unit cell is required to achieve electrical neutrality and corresponds to the bulk stoichiometry of the compound.</p>

Within a year, two British physicists, William Henry Bragg (1862–1942) and his son, William Lawrence Bragg (1890–1972), had worked out the mathematics that allows x-ray diffraction to be used to measure interatomic distances in crystals. The Braggs shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1915, when the son was only 25 years old. Virtually everything we know today about the detailed structures of solids and molecules in solids is due to the x-ray diffraction technique.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p02">Recall from <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch06#averill_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "The Structure of Atoms"</a> that two waves that are in phase interfere constructively, thus reinforcing each other and generating a wave with a greater amplitude. In contrast, two waves that are out of phase interfere destructively, effectively canceling each other. When x-rays interact with the components of a crystalline lattice, they are scattered by the electron clouds associated with each atom. As shown in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12_s02#averill_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_f02">Figure 12.5 "The Three Kinds of Cubic Unit Cell"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12_s02#averill_1.0-ch12_s02_s02_s03_f02">Figure 12.7 "Close-Packed Structures: hcp and ccp"</a>, and <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_f01">Figure 12.8 "Holes in Cubic Lattices"</a>, the atoms in crystalline solids are typically arranged in planes. <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_f02">Figure 12.14 "The Reflection of X-Rays from Two Adjacent Planes of Atoms Can Result in Constructive Interference of the X-Rays"</a> illustrates how two adjacent planes of atoms can scatter x-rays in a way that results in constructive interference.

Placing a cation in the cubic hole results in the <strong class="emphasis bold">cesium chloride structure</strong>, with a 1:1 cation:anion ratio and a coordination number of 8 for both the cation and the anion. An fcc array of atoms or ions contains both <strong class="emphasis bold">octahedral holes</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">tetrahedral holes</strong>. If the octahedral holes in an fcc lattice of anions are filled with cations, the result is a <strong class="emphasis bold">sodium chloride structure</strong>.

Occupation of half the tetrahedral holes by cations results in the <strong class="emphasis bold">zinc blende structure</strong>, with a 1:1 cation:anion ratio and a coordination number of 4 for the cations. More complex structures are possible if there are more than two kinds of atoms in a solid.

        <li>It is impossible to obtain any substance in 100% pure form. Some impurities are always present.</li>
        <li>Even if a substance were 100% pure, forming a perfect crystal would require cooling the liquid phase infinitely slowly to allow all atoms, ions, or molecules to find their proper positions. Cooling at more realistic rates usually results in one or more components being trapped in the “wrong” place in a lattice or in areas where two lattices that grew separately intersect.</li>

To illustrate the process, suppose you have a heavy rug that is lying a few inches off-center on a nonskid pad. To move the rug to its proper place, you could pick up one end and pull it. Because of the large area of contact between the rug and the pad, however, they will probably move as a unit. Alternatively, you could pick up the rug and try to set it back down exactly where you want it, but that requires a great deal of effort (and probably at least one extra person). An easier solution is to create a small wrinkle at one end of the rug (an edge dislocation) and gradually push the wrinkle across, resulting in a net movement of the rug as a whole (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_f02">Figure 12.17 "The Role of Dislocation in the Motion of One Planar Object across Another"</a>). Moving the wrinkle requires only a small amount of energy because only a small part of the rug is actually moving at any one time. Similarly, in a solid, the contacts between layers are broken in only one place at a time, which facilitates the deformation process.</p>

Similarly, intersecting dislocations in a solid prevent them from moving, thereby increasing the mechanical strength of the material. In fact, one of the major goals of materials science is to find ways to pin dislocations to strengthen or harden a material.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_p04">Pinning can also be achieved by introducing selected impurities in appropriate amounts. Substitutional impurities that are a mismatch in size to the host prevent dislocations from migrating smoothly along a plane. Generally, the higher the concentration of impurities, the more effectively they block migration, and the stronger the material. For example, bronze, which contains about 20% tin and 80% copper by mass, produces a much harder and sharper weapon than does either pure tin or pure copper. Similarly, pure gold is too soft to make durable jewelry, so most gold jewelry contains 75% (18 carat) or 58% (14 carat) gold by mass, with the remainder consisting of copper, silver, or both.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_p05">If an interstitial impurity forms polar covalent bonds to the host atoms, the layers are prevented from sliding past one another, even when only a small amount of the impurity is present. For example, because iron forms polar covalent bonds to carbon, the strongest steels need to contain only about 1% carbon by mass to substantially increase their strength (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s01_t01">Table 12.3 "Compositions, Properties, and Uses of Some Types of Steel"</a>).</p>

Bending an object made of the low-temperature (kinked) phase creates defects that change the pattern of kinks within the structure. If the object is heated to a temperature greater than about 50°C, the material undergoes a transition to the cubic high-temperature phase, causing the object to return to its original shape.

The three transition elements (Mn, Ni, and Cr) lie near Fe in the periodic table, so they should be similar to Fe in chemical properties and atomic size (atomic radius = 125 pm). Hence they almost certainly will substitute for iron in the Fe lattice. Carbon is a second-period element that is nonmetallic and much smaller (atomic radius = 77 pm) than iron. Carbon will therefore tend to occupy interstitial sites in the iron lattice. Phosphorus and silicon are chemically quite different from iron (phosphorus is a nonmetal, and silicon is a semimetal), even though they are similar in size (atomic radii of 106 and 111 pm, respectively). Thus they are unlikely to be substitutional impurities in the iron lattice or fit into interstitial sites, but they could aggregate into layers that would constitute plane defects.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s03_p01">All the defects and impurities described for metals are seen in ionic and molecular compounds as well. Because ionic compounds contain both cations and anions rather than only neutral atoms, however, they exhibit additional types of defects that are not possible in metals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s03_p02">The most straightforward variant is a substitutional impurity in which a cation or an anion is replaced by another of similar charge and size. For example, Br<sup class="superscript">−</sup> can substitute for Cl<sup class="superscript">−</sup>, so tiny amounts of Br<sup class="superscript">−</sup> are usually present in a chloride salt such as CaCl<sub class="subscript">2</sub> or BaCl<sub class="subscript">2</sub>. If the substitutional impurity and the host have <em class="emphasis">different</em> charges, however, the situation becomes more complicated. Suppose, for example, that Sr<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> (ionic radius = 118 pm) substitutes for K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> (ionic radius = 138 pm) in KCl. Because the ions are approximately the same size, Sr<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> should fit nicely into the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice of KCl. The difference in charge, however, must somehow be compensated for so that electrical neutrality is preserved. The simplest way is for a second K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ion to be lost elsewhere in the crystal, producing a vacancy. Thus substitution of K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> by Sr<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> in KCl results in the introduction of <em class="emphasis">two</em> defects: a site in which an Sr<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ion occupies a K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> position and a vacant cation site. Substitutional impurities whose charges do not match the host’s are often introduced intentionally to produce compounds with specific properties (see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12_s07#averill_1.0-ch12_s07">Section 12.7 "Superconductors"</a>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s03_p03">Virtually all the colored gems used in jewelry are due to substitutional impurities in simple oxide structures. For example, α-Al<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">3</sub>, a hard white solid called <em class="emphasis">corundum</em> that is used as an abrasive in fine sandpaper, is the primary component, or <em class="emphasis">matrix</em>, of a wide variety of gems. Because many trivalent transition metal ions have ionic radii only a little larger than the radius of Al<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> (ionic radius = 53.5 pm), they can replace Al<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> in the octahedral holes of the oxide lattice. Substituting small amounts of Cr<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> ions (ionic radius = 75 pm) for Al<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> gives the deep red color of ruby, and a mixture of impurities (Fe<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>, Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup>, and Ti<sup class="superscript">4+</sup>) gives the deep blue of sapphire. True amethyst contains small amounts of Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> in an SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> (quartz) matrix.

For example, Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> ions are responsible for the yellow color of topaz and the violet color of amethyst.

In response to an applied voltage, the cations in solid electrolytes can diffuse rapidly through the lattice via octahedral holes, creating Frenkel defects as the cations migrate. Sodium–sulfur batteries use a solid Al<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">3</sub> electrolyte with small amounts of solid Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O.

            <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s04_p04">Real crystals contain large numbers of <strong class="emphasis bold">defects</strong>. Defects may affect only a single point in the lattice (a <strong class="emphasis bold">point defect</strong>), a row of lattice points (a <strong class="emphasis bold">line defect</strong>), or a plane of atoms (a <strong class="emphasis bold">plane defect</strong>). A point defect can be an atom missing from a site in the crystal (a <strong class="emphasis bold">vacancy</strong>) or an impurity atom that occupies either a normal lattice site (a <strong class="emphasis bold">substitutional impurity</strong>) or a hole in the lattice between atoms (an <strong class="emphasis bold">interstitial impurity</strong>). In an <strong class="emphasis bold">edge dislocation</strong>, an extra plane of atoms is inserted into part of the crystal lattice. Multiple defects can be introduced into materials so that the presence of one defect prevents the motion of another, in a process called <strong class="emphasis bold">pinning</strong>. Because defect motion tends to stop at <strong class="emphasis bold">grain boundaries</strong>, controlling the size of the grains in a material controls its mechanical properties. In addition, a process called <strong class="emphasis bold">work hardening</strong> introduces defects to toughen metals. <strong class="emphasis bold">Schottky defects</strong> are a coupled pair of vacancies—one cation and one anion—that maintains electrical neutrality. A <strong class="emphasis bold">Frenkel defect</strong> is an ion that occupies an incorrect site in the lattice. Cations in such compounds are often able to move rapidly from one site in the crystal to another, resulting in high electrical conductivity in the solid material. Such compounds are called <strong class="emphasis bold">solid electrolytes</strong>. <strong class="emphasis bold">Nonstoichiometric compounds</strong> have variable stoichiometries over a given range with no dramatic change in crystal structure. This behavior is due to a large number of vacancies or substitutions of one ion by another ion with a different charge.</p>

Larger impurity atoms are likely to form “bumps” or kinks that will make it harder for layers of atoms to move across one another. Interstitial atoms that form polar covalent bonds with the metal atoms tend to occupy spaces between the layers; they act as a “glue” that holds layers of metal atoms together, which greatly decreases the ductility.</p>

The strength of the attractive forces depends on the charge and size of the ions that compose the lattice and determines many of the physical properties of the crystal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s05_s01_p02">The <strong class="emphasis bold">lattice energy</strong>, the energy required to separate 1 mol of a crystalline ionic solid into its component ions in the gas phase, is directly proportional to the product of the ionic charges and inversely proportional to the sum of the radii of the ions. For example, NaF and CaO both crystallize in the face-centered cubic (fcc) sodium chloride structure, and the sizes of their component ions are about the same: Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup> (102 pm) versus Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> (100 pm), and F<sup class="superscript">−</sup> (133 pm) versus O<sup class="superscript">2−</sup> (140 pm). Because of the higher charge on the ions in CaO, however, the lattice energy of CaO is almost four times greater than that of NaF (3401 kJ/mol versus 923 kJ/mol). The forces that hold Ca and O together in CaO are much stronger than those that hold Na and F together in NaF, so the heat of fusion of CaO is almost twice that of NaF (59 kJ/mol versus 33.4 kJ/mol), and the melting point of CaO is 2927°C versus 996°C for NaF. In both cases, however, the values are large; that is, simple ionic compounds have high melting points and are relatively hard (and brittle) solids.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s05_s02_p02">Because the intermolecular interactions in a molecular solid are relatively weak compared with ionic and covalent bonds, molecular solids tend to be soft, low melting, and easily vaporized (Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">fus</sub> and Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">vap</sub> are low). For similar substances, the strength of the London dispersion forces increases smoothly with increasing molecular mass. For example, the melting points of benzene (C<sub class="subscript">6</sub>H<sub class="subscript">6</sub>), naphthalene (C<sub class="subscript">10</sub>H<sub class="subscript">8</sub>), and anthracene (C<sub class="subscript">14</sub>H<sub class="subscript">10</sub>), with one, two, and three fused aromatic rings, are 5.5°C, 80.2°C, and 215°C, respectively. The enthalpies of fusion also increase smoothly within the series: benzene (9.95 kJ/mol) &lt; naphthalene (19.1 kJ/mol) &lt; anthracene (28.8 kJ/mol). If the molecules have shapes that cannot pack together efficiently in the crystal, however, then the melting points and the enthalpies of fusion tend to be unexpectedly low because the molecules are unable to arrange themselves to optimize intermolecular interactions. Thus toluene (C<sub class="subscript">6</sub>H<sub class="subscript">5</sub>CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>) and <em class="emphasis">m</em>-xylene [<em class="emphasis">m</em>-C<sub class="subscript">6</sub>H<sub class="subscript">4</sub>(CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>)<sub class="subscript">2</sub>] have melting points of −95°C and −48°C, respectively, which are significantly lower than the melting point of the lighter but more symmetrical analog, benzene.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p02">The unit cell of diamond can be described as an fcc array of carbon atoms with four additional carbon atoms inserted into four of the tetrahedral holes. It thus has the zinc blende structure described in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12_s03#averill_1.0-ch12_s03">Section 12.3 "Structures of Simple Binary Compounds"</a>, except that in zinc blende the atoms that compose the fcc array are sulfur and the atoms in the tetrahedral holes are zinc. Elemental silicon has the same structure, as does silicon carbide (SiC), which has alternating C and Si atoms. The structure of crystalline quartz (SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), shown in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12_s01#averill_1.0-ch12_s01">Section 12.1 "Crystalline and Amorphous Solids"</a>, can be viewed as being derived from the structure of silicon by inserting an oxygen atom between each pair of silicon atoms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p03">All compounds with the diamond and related structures are hard, high-melting-point solids that are not easily deformed. Instead, they tend to shatter when subjected to large stresses, and they usually do not conduct electricity very well. In fact, diamond (melting point = 3500°C at 63.5 atm) is one of the hardest substances known, and silicon carbide (melting point = 2986°C) is used commercially as an abrasive in sandpaper and grinding wheels. It is difficult to deform or melt these and related compounds because strong covalent (C–C or Si–Si) or polar covalent (Si–C or Si–O) bonds must be broken, which requires a large input of energy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p04">Other covalent solids have very different structures. For example, graphite, the other common allotrope of carbon, has the structure shown in part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_f01">Figure 12.19 "The Structures of Diamond and Graphite"</a>. It contains planar networks of six-membered rings of <em class="emphasis">sp</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup> hybridized carbon atoms in which each carbon is bonded to three others. This leaves a single electron in an unhybridized 2<em class="emphasis">p</em><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">z</em></sub> orbital that can be used to form C=C double bonds, resulting in a ring with alternating double and single bonds. Because of its resonance structures, the bonding in graphite is best viewed as consisting of a network of C–C single bonds with one-third of a π bond holding the carbons together, similar to the bonding in benzene.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p05">To completely describe the bonding in graphite, we need a molecular orbital approach similar to the one used for benzene in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch09#averill_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Molecular Geometry and Covalent Bonding Models"</a>. In fact, the C–C distance in graphite (141.5 pm) is slightly longer than the distance in benzene (139.5 pm), consistent with a net carbon–carbon bond order of 1.33. In graphite, the two-dimensional planes of carbon atoms are stacked to form a three-dimensional solid; only London dispersion forces hold the layers together. As a result, graphite exhibits properties typical of both covalent and molecular solids. Due to strong covalent bonding within the layers, graphite has a very high melting point, as expected for a covalent solid (it actually sublimes at about 3915°C). It is also very soft; the layers can easily slide past one another because of the weak interlayer interactions. Consequently, graphite is used as a lubricant and as the “lead” in pencils; the friction between graphite and a piece of paper is sufficient to leave a thin layer of carbon on the paper. Graphite is unusual among covalent solids in that its electrical conductivity is very high parallel to the planes of carbon atoms because of delocalized C–C π bonding. Finally, graphite is black because it contains an immense number of alternating double bonds, which results in a very small energy difference between the individual molecular orbitals. Thus light of virtually all wavelengths is absorbed. Diamond, on the other hand, is colorless when pure because it has no delocalized electrons.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s05_s04_p04">The strength of metallic bonds varies dramatically. For example, cesium melts at 28.4°C, and mercury is a liquid at room temperature, whereas tungsten melts at 3680°C. Metallic bonds tend to be weakest for elements that have nearly empty (as in Cs) or nearly full (Hg) valence subshells, and strongest for elements with approximately half-filled valence shells (as in W). As a result, the melting points of the metals increase to a maximum around group 6 and then decrease again from left to right across the <em class="emphasis">d</em> block. Other properties related to the strength of metallic bonds, such as enthalpies of fusion, boiling points, and hardness, have similar periodic trends.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s05_s04_p05">A somewhat oversimplified way to describe the bonding in a metallic crystal is to depict the crystal as consisting of positively charged nuclei in an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">electron sea</a><span class="glossdef">Valence electrons that are delocalized throughout a metallic solid.</span></span> (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s05_s04_f01">Figure 12.20 "The Electron-Sea Model of Bonding in Metals"</a>). In this model, the valence electrons are not tightly bound to any one atom but are distributed uniformly throughout the structure. Very little energy is needed to remove electrons from a solid metal because they are not bound to a single nucleus. When an electrical potential is applied, the electrons can migrate through the solid toward the positive electrode, thus producing high electrical conductivity. The ease with which metals can be deformed under pressure is attributed to the ability of the metal ions to change positions within the electron sea without breaking any specific bonds. The transfer of energy through the solid by successive collisions between the metal ions also explains the high thermal conductivity of metals. This model does not, however, explain many of the other properties of metals, such as their metallic luster and the observed trends in bond strength as reflected in melting points or enthalpies of fusion.

                <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s05_s04_s01_p16">The major types of solids are ionic, molecular, covalent, and metallic. <strong class="emphasis bold">Ionic solids</strong> consist of positively and negatively charged ions held together by electrostatic forces; the strength of the bonding is reflected in the lattice energy. Ionic solids tend to have high melting points and are rather hard. <strong class="emphasis bold">Molecular solids</strong> are held together by relatively weak forces, such as dipole–dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, and London dispersion forces. As a result, they tend to be rather soft and have low melting points, which depend on their molecular structure. <strong class="emphasis bold">Covalent solids</strong> consist of two- or three-dimensional networks of atoms held together by covalent bonds; they tend to be very hard and have high melting points. <strong class="emphasis bold">Metallic solids</strong> have unusual properties: in addition to having high thermal and electrical conductivity and being malleable and ductile, they exhibit luster, a shiny surface that reflects light. An <strong class="emphasis bold">alloy</strong> is a mixture of metals that has bulk metallic properties different from those of its constituent elements. Alloys can be formed by substituting one metal atom for another of similar size in the lattice (<strong class="emphasis bold">substitutional alloys</strong>), by inserting smaller atoms into holes in the metal lattice (<strong class="emphasis bold">interstitial alloys</strong>), or by a combination of both. Although the elemental composition of most alloys can vary over wide ranges, certain metals combine in only fixed proportions to form <strong class="emphasis bold">intermetallic compounds</strong> with unique properties.</p>

                            <p class="para">In a substitutional alloy, the impurity atoms are similar in size and chemical properties to the atoms of the host lattice; consequently, they simply replace some of the metal atoms in the normal lattice and do not greatly perturb the structure and physical properties. In an interstitial alloy, the impurity atoms are generally much smaller, have very different chemical properties, and occupy holes between the larger metal atoms. Because interstitial impurities form covalent bonds to the metal atoms in the host lattice, they tend to have a large effect on the mechanical properties of the metal, making it harder, less ductile, and more brittle. Comparing the mechanical properties of an alloy with those of the parent metal could be used to decide whether the alloy were a substitutional or interstitial alloy.</p>

Metals conduct electricity, for example, because only a very small amount of energy is required to excite an electron from a filled level to an empty one, where it is free to migrate rapidly throughout the crystal in response to an applied electric field. Similarly, metals have high heat capacities (as you no doubt remember from the last time a doctor or a nurse placed a stethoscope on your skin) because the electrons in the valence band can absorb thermal energy by being excited to the low-lying empty energy levels. Finally, metals are lustrous because light of various wavelengths can be absorbed, causing the valence electrons to be excited into any of the empty energy levels above the highest occupied level. When the electrons decay back to low-lying empty levels, they emit light of different wavelengths. Because electrons can be excited from many different filled levels in a metallic solid and can then decay back to any of many empty levels, light of varying wavelengths is absorbed and reemitted, which results in the characteristic shiny appearance that we associate with metals.</p>

The electrical conductivity of a semiconductor therefore increases rapidly with increasing temperature, in contrast to the behavior of a purely metallic crystal. In a metal, as an electron travels through the crystal in response to an applied electrical potential, it cannot travel very far before it encounters and collides with a metal nucleus. The more often such encounters occur, the slower the <em class="emphasis">net</em> motion of the electron through the crystal, and the <em class="emphasis">lower</em> the conductivity. As the temperature of the solid increases, the metal atoms in the lattice acquire more and more kinetic energy. Because their positions are fixed in the lattice, however, the increased kinetic energy increases only the extent to which they vibrate about their fixed positions. At higher temperatures, therefore, the metal nuclei collide with the mobile electrons more frequently and with greater energy, thus <em class="emphasis">decreasing</em> the conductivity. This effect is, however, substantially smaller than the increase in conductivity with temperature exhibited by semiconductors. For example, the conductivity of a tungsten wire decreases by a factor of only about two over the temperature range 750–1500 K, whereas the conductivity of silicon increases approximately 100-fold over the same temperature range.

                <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s06_s04_s02_p16"><strong class="emphasis bold">Band theory</strong> assumes that the valence orbitals of the atoms in a solid interact to generate a set of molecular orbitals that extend throughout the solid; the continuous set of allowed energy levels is an <strong class="emphasis bold">energy band</strong>. The difference in energy between the highest and lowest allowed levels within a given band is the <strong class="emphasis bold">bandwidth</strong>, and the difference in energy between the highest level of one band and the lowest level of the band above it is the <strong class="emphasis bold">band gap</strong>. If the width of adjacent bands is larger than the energy gap between them, <strong class="emphasis bold">overlapping bands</strong> result, in which molecular orbitals derived from two or more kinds of valence orbitals have similar energies. Metallic properties depend on a partially occupied band corresponding to a set of molecular orbitals that extend throughout the solid to form a band of energy levels. If a solid has a filled valence band with a relatively low-lying empty band above it (a <strong class="emphasis bold">conduction band</strong>), then electrons can be excited by thermal energy from the filled band into the vacant band where they can then migrate through the crystal, resulting in electrical conductivity. <strong class="emphasis bold">Electrical insulators</strong> are poor conductors because their valence bands are full. <strong class="emphasis bold">Semiconductors</strong> have electrical conductivities intermediate between those of insulators and metals. The electrical conductivity of semiconductors increases rapidly with increasing temperature, whereas the electrical conductivity of metals decreases slowly with increasing temperature. The properties of semiconductors can be modified by <strong class="emphasis bold">doping</strong>, or introducing impurities. Adding an element with more valence electrons than the atoms of the host populates the conduction band, resulting in an <em class="emphasis bolditalic">n</em><strong class="emphasis bold">-type semiconductor</strong> with increased electrical conductivity. Adding an element with fewer valence electrons than the atoms of the host generates holes in the valence band, resulting in a <em class="emphasis bolditalic">p</em><strong class="emphasis bold">-type semiconductor</strong> that also exhibits increased electrical conductivity.</p>

                            <p class="para">As the ionic character of a compound increases, the band gap will also increase due to a decrease in orbital overlap. Remember that overlap is greatest for orbitals of the same energy, and that the difference in energy between orbitals on adjacent atoms increases as the difference in electronegativity between the atoms increases. Thus, large differences in electronegativity increase the ionic character, decrease the orbital overlap, and increase the band gap.</p>

Kamerlingh Onnes (1853–1926; Nobel Prize in Physics, 1913), who found a way to liquefy helium, which boils at 4.2 K and 1 atm pressure. To exploit the very low temperatures made possible by this new cryogenic fluid, he began a systematic study of the properties of metals, especially their electrical properties. Because the electrical resistance of a sample is technically easier to measure than its conductivity, Onnes measured the <em class="emphasis">resistivity</em> of his samples. The resistivity and conductivity of a material are inversely proportional:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s07_s01_p01">For many years, the phenomenon of superconductivity could not be satisfactorily explained by the laws of conventional physics. In the early 1950s, however, American physicists John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schrieffer formulated a theory for superconductivity that earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972. According to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">BCS theory</a><span class="glossdef">A theory used to explain the phenomenon of superconductivity.</span></span> (named for the initials of their last names), electrons are able to travel through a solid with zero resistance because of attractive interactions involving two electrons that are at some distance from each other. As one electron moves through the lattice, the surrounding nuclei are attracted to it. The motion of the nuclei can create a transient (short-lived) hole that pulls the second electron in the same direction as the first. The nuclei then return to their original positions to avoid colliding with the second electron as it approaches. The pairs of electrons, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cooper pairs</a><span class="glossdef">Pairs of electrons that migrate through a superconducting material as a unit.</span></span>, migrate through the crystal as a unit. The electrons in Cooper pairs change partners frequently, like dancers in a ballet.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s07_s01_p02">According to the BCS theory, as the temperature of the solid increases, the vibrations of the atoms in the lattice increase continuously, until eventually the electrons cannot avoid colliding with them. The collisions result in the loss of superconductivity at higher temperatures.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s07_s01_p03">The phenomenon of superconductivity suggested many exciting technological applications. For example, using superconducting wires in power cables would result in zero power losses, even over distances of hundreds of miles. Additionally, because superconductors expel magnetic fields, a combination of magnetic rails and superconducting wheels (or vice versa) could be used to produce <em class="emphasis">magnetic levitation</em> of, for example, a train over the track, resulting in friction-free transportation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s07_s01_p04">Unfortunately, for many years the only superconductors known had serious limitations, especially the need for very low temperatures, which required the use of expensive cryogenic fluids such as liquid He. In addition, the superconducting properties of many substances are destroyed by large electrical currents or even moderately large magnetic fields, making them useless for applications in power cables or high-field magnets. The ability of materials such as NbTi, NbSn, Nb<sub class="subscript">3</sub>Si, and Nb<sub class="subscript">3</sub>Ge to tolerate rather high magnetic fields, however, has led to a number of commercial applications of superconductors, including high-field magnets for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instruments in medicine, which, unlike x-rays, can detect small changes in soft tissues in the body.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">High-Temperature Superconductors</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s07_s02_p01">Because of these limitations, scientists continued to search for materials that exhibited superconductivity at temperatures greater than 77 K (the temperature of liquid nitrogen, the least expensive cryogenic fluid). In 1986, Johannes G. Bednorz and Karl A. Müller, working for IBM in Zurich, showed that certain mixed-metal oxides containing La, Ba, and Cu exhibited superconductivity above 30 K. These compounds had been prepared by French workers as potential solid catalysts some years earlier, but their electrical properties had never been examined at low temperatures. Although initially the scientific community was extremely skeptical, the compounds were so easy to prepare that the results were confirmed within a few weeks. These <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">high-temperature superconductors</a><span class="glossdef">A material that becomes a superconductor at temperatures greater than 30 K.</span></span> earned Bednorz and Müller the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1987. Subsequent research has produced new compounds with related structures that are superconducting at temperatures as high as 135 K. The best known of these was discovered by Paul Chu and Maw-Kuen Wu Jr. and is called the “Chu–Wu phase” or the 1-2-3 superconductor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s07_s02_p02">The formula for the 1-2-3 superconductor is YBa<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Cu<sub class="subscript">3</sub>O<sub class="subscript">7−</sub><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">x</em></sub>, where <em class="emphasis">x</em> is about 0.1 for samples that superconduct at about 95 K. If <em class="emphasis">x</em> ≈ 1.0, giving a formula of YBa<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Cu<sub class="subscript">3</sub>O<sub class="subscript">6</sub>, the material is an electrical insulator. The superconducting phase is thus a nonstoichiometric compound, with a fixed ratio of metal atoms but a variable oxygen content. The overall equation for the synthesis of this material is as follows:</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Synthetic Polymers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p01">Many of the synthetic polymers we use, such as plastics and rubbers, have commercial advantages over naturally occurring polymers because they can be produced inexpensively. Moreover, many synthetic polymers are actually more desirable than their natural counterparts because scientists can select monomer units to tailor the physical properties of the resulting polymer for particular purposes. For example, in many applications, wood has been replaced by plastics that are more durable, lighter, and easier to shape and maintain. Polymers are also increasingly used in engineering applications where weight reduction and corrosion resistance are required. Steel rods used to support concrete structures, for example, are often coated with a polymeric material when the structures are near ocean environments where steel is vulnerable to corrosion (For more information on corrosion, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch19#averill_1.0-ch19">Chapter 19 "Electrochemistry"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch19_s06#averill_1.0-ch19_s06">Section 19.6 "Corrosion"</a>.) In fact, the use of polymers in engineering applications is a very active area of research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p02">Probably the best-known example of a synthetic polymer is <em class="emphasis">nylon</em> (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_f01">Figure 12.32 "The Synthesis of Nylon"</a>). Its monomers are linked by amide bonds (which are called peptide bonds in biological polymers), so its physical properties are similar to those of some proteins because of their common structural unit—the amide group. Nylon is easily drawn into silky <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fibers</a><span class="glossdef">A particle of a synthetic polymer that is more than 100 times longer than it is wide.</span></span> that are more than a hundred times longer than they are wide and can be woven into fabrics. Nylon fibers are so light and strong that during World War II, all available nylon was commandeered for use in parachutes, ropes, and other military items. With polymer chains that are fully extended and run parallel to the fiber axis, nylon fibers resist stretching, just like naturally occurring silk fibers, although the structures of nylon and silk are otherwise different. Replacing the flexible –CH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>– units in nylon by aromatic rings produces a stiffer and stronger polymer, such as the very strong polymer known as Kevlar. Kevlar fibers are so strong and rigid that they are used in lightweight army helmets, bulletproof vests, and even sailboat and canoe hulls, all of which contain multiple layers of Kevlar fabric.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p03">Not all synthetic polymers are linked by amide bonds—for example, <em class="emphasis">polyesters</em> contain monomers that are linked by ester bonds. Polyesters are sold under trade names such as Dacron, Kodel, and Fortrel, which are used in clothing, and Mylar, which is used in magnetic tape, helium-filled balloons, and high-tech sails for sailboats. Although the fibers are flexible, properly prepared Mylar films are almost as strong as steel.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p04">Polymers based on skeletons with only carbon are all synthetic. Most of these are formed from ethylene (CH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>=CH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), a two-carbon building block, and its derivatives. The relative lengths of the chains and any branches control the properties of polyethylene. For example, higher numbers of branches produce a softer, more flexible, lower-melting-point polymer called low-density polyethylene (LDPE), whereas high-density polyethylene (HDPE) contains few branches. Substances such as glass that melt at relatively low temperatures can also be formed into fibers, producing <em class="emphasis">fiberglass</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p05">Because most synthetic fibers are neither soluble nor low melting, multistep processes are required to manufacture them and form them into objects.

The usual precursor for graphite is polyacrylonitrile, better known by its trade name—Orlon. A similar approach is used to prepare fibers of silicon carbide using an organosilicon precursor such as polydimethylsilane {[–(CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>)<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Si–]<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub>}. A new type of fiber consisting of carbon nanotubes, hollow cylinders of carbon just one atom thick, is lightweight, strong, and impact resistant.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p06">Because there are no good polymer precursors for elemental boron or boron nitride, these fibers have to be prepared by time-consuming and costly indirect methods. Even though boron fibers are about eight times stronger than metallic aluminum and 10% lighter, they are significantly more expensive. Consequently, unless an application requires boron’s greater resistance to oxidation, these fibers cannot compete with less costly graphite fibers.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s09_p01">In addition to polymers, other materials, such as ceramics, high-strength alloys, and composites, play a major role in almost every aspect of our lives. Until relatively recently, steel was used for any application that required an especially strong and durable material, such as bridges, automobiles, airplanes, golf clubs, and tennis rackets. In the last 15 to 20 years, however, graphite or boron fiber golf clubs and tennis rackets have made wood and steel obsolete for these items. Likewise, a modern jet engine now is largely composed of Ti and Ni by weight rather than steel (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s09_t01">Table 12.8 "The Approximate Elemental Composition of a Modern Jet Engine"</a>). The percentage of iron in wings and fuselages is similarly low, which indicates the extent to which other materials have supplanted steel. The Chevrolet Corvette introduced in 1953 was considered unusual because its body was constructed of fiberglass, a composite material, rather than steel; by 1992, Jaguar fabricated an all-aluminum limited-edition vehicle. In fact, the current models of many automobiles have engines that are made mostly of aluminum rather than steel. In this section, we describe some of the chemistry behind three classes of contemporary materials: ceramics, superalloys, and composites.</p>

Traditional ceramics, which are based on metal silicates or aluminosilicates, are the materials used to make pottery, china, bricks, and concrete. Modern ceramics contain a much wider range of components and can be classified as either <em class="emphasis">ceramic oxides</em>, which are based on metal oxides such as alumina (Al<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">3</sub>), zirconia (ZrO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), and beryllia (BeO), or <em class="emphasis">nonoxide ceramics</em>, which are based on metal carbides such as silicon carbide (carborundum, SiC) and tungsten carbide (WC), or nitrides like silicon nitride (Si<sub class="subscript">3</sub>N<sub class="subscript">4</sub>) and boron nitride (BN).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s09_s01_p02">All modern ceramics are hard, lightweight, and stable at very high temperatures. Unfortunately, however, they are also rather brittle, tending to crack or break under stresses that would cause metals to bend or dent. Thus a major challenge for materials scientists is to take advantage of the desirable properties of ceramics, such as their thermal and oxidative stability, chemical inertness, and toughness, while finding ways to decrease their brittleness to use them in new applications. Few metals can be used in jet engines, for example, because most lose mechanical strength and react with oxygen at the very high operating temperatures inside the engines (approximately 2000°C). In contrast, ceramic oxides such as Al<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">3</sub> cannot react with oxygen regardless of the temperature because aluminum is already in its highest possible oxidation state (Al<sup class="superscript">3+</sup>). Even nonoxide ceramics such as silicon and boron nitrides and silicon carbide are essentially unreactive in air up to about 1500°C. Producing a high-strength ceramic for service use involves a process called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sintering</a><span class="glossdef">A process that fuses the grains of a ceramic into a dense, strong material. Sintering is used to produce high-strength ceramics.</span></span>, which fuses the grains into a dense and strong material (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s09_s01_f01">Figure 12.33 "Sintering"</a>).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s09_s01_p04">One of the most widely used raw materials for making ceramics is clay. Clay minerals consist of hydrated alumina (Al<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">3</sub>) and silica (SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>) that have a broad range of impurities, including barium, calcium, sodium, potassium, and iron. Although the structures of clay minerals are complicated, they all contain layers of metal atoms linked by oxygen atoms. Water molecules fit between the layers to form a thin film of water. When hydrated, clays can be easily molded, but during high-temperature heat treatment, called <em class="emphasis">firing</em>, a dense and strong ceramic is produced.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s09_s01_p05">Because ceramics are so hard, they are easily contaminated by the material used to grind them. In fact, the ceramic often grinds the metal surface of the mill almost as fast as the mill grinds the ceramic! The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sol-gel process</a><span class="glossdef">A process used to manufacture ceramics by producing fine powders of ceramic oxides with uniformly sized particles.</span></span> was developed to address this problem. In this process, a water-soluble precursor species, usually a metal or semimetal alkoxide [M(OR)<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub>] undergoes a hydrolysis reaction to form a cloudy aqueous dispersion called a <em class="emphasis">sol</em>. The sol contains particles of the metal or semimetal hydroxide [M(OH)<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub>], which are typically 1–100 nm in diameter. As the reaction proceeds, molecules of water are eliminated from between the M(OH)<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub> units in a condensation reaction, and the particles fuse together, producing oxide bridges, M–O–M. Eventually, the particles become linked in a three-dimensional network that causes the solution to form a <em class="emphasis">gel</em>, similar to a gelatin dessert. Heating the gel to 200°C–500°C causes more water to be eliminated, thus forming small particles of metal oxide that can be amazingly uniform in size. This chemistry starts with highly pure SiCl<sub class="subscript">4</sub> and proceeds via the following reactions:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s09_s02_p03">Although most superalloys are based on nickel, cobalt, or iron, other metals are used as well. Pure nickel or cobalt is relatively easily oxidized, but adding small amounts of other metals (Al, Co, Cr, Mo, Nb, Ti, and W) results in an alloy that has superior properties. Consequently, most of the internal parts of modern gas turbine jet engines are now made of superalloys based on either nickel (used in blades and disks) or cobalt (used in vanes, combustion chamber liners, and afterburners). The cobalt-based superalloys are not as strong as the nickel-based ones, but they have excellent corrosion resistance at high temperatures.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s09_s02_p04">Other alloys, such as aluminum–lithium and alloys based on titanium, also have applications in the aerospace industry. Because aluminum–lithium alloys are lighter, stiffer, and more resistant to fatigue at high temperatures than aluminum itself, they are used in engine parts and in the metal “skins” that cover wings and bodies. Titanium’s high strength, corrosion resistance, and lightweight properties are equally desirable for applications where minimizing weight is important (as in airplanes). Unfortunately, however, metallic titanium reacts rapidly with air at high temperatures to form TiN and TiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>. The welding of titanium or any similar processes must therefore be carried out in an argon or inert gas atmosphere, which adds significantly to the cost. Initially, titanium and its alloys were primarily used in military applications, but more recently, they have been used as components of the airframes of commercial planes, in ship structures, and in biological implants.</p>

The resulting material is stronger, tougher, stiffer, and more resistant to corrosion than either component alone. Composites are thus the nanometer-scale equivalent of reinforced concrete, in which steel rods greatly increase the mechanical strength of the cement matrix, and are extensively used in the aircraft industry, among others. For example, the Boeing 777 is 9% composites by weight, whereas the newly developed Boeing 787 is 50% composites by weight. Not only does the use of composite materials reduce the weight of the aircraft, and therefore its fuel consumption, but it also allows new design concepts because composites can be molded. Moreover, by using composites in the Boeing 787 multiple functions can be integrated into a single system, such as acoustic damping, thermal regulation, and the electrical system.</p>

The result is a strong, stiff, lightweight material that is resistant to chemical degradation. It is not strong enough, however, to resist cracking or puncturing on impact. Stronger, stiffer polymer-matrix composites contain fibers of carbon (graphite), boron, or polyamides such as Kevlar. High-tech tennis rackets and golf clubs as well as the skins of modern military aircraft such as the “stealth” F-117A fighters and B-2 bombers are made from both carbon fiber–epoxy and boron fiber–epoxy composites. Compared with metals, these materials are 25%–50% lighter and thus reduce operating costs. Similarly, the space shuttle payload bay doors and panels are made of a carbon fiber–epoxy composite. The structure of the Boeing 787 has been described as essentially one giant macromolecule, where everything is fastened through cross-linked chemical bonds reinforced with carbon fiber.</p>

They offer significant advantages for high-temperature applications but pose major manufacturing challenges. For example, obtaining a uniform distribution and alignment of the reinforcing fibers can be difficult, and because organic polymers cannot survive the high temperatures of molten metals, only fibers composed of boron, carbon, or ceramic (such as silicon carbide) can be used. Aluminum alloys reinforced with boron fibers are used in the aerospace industry, where their strength and lightweight properties make up for their relatively high cost. The skins of hypersonic aircraft and structural units in the space shuttle are made of metal-matrix composites.</p>

A typical example is alumina reinforced with silicon carbide fibers. Combining the two very high-melting-point materials results in a composite that has excellent thermal stability, great strength, and corrosion resistance, while the SiC fibers reduce brittleness and cracking. Consequently, these materials are used in very high-temperature applications, such as the leading edge of wings of hypersonic airplanes and jet engine parts. They are also used in the protective ceramic tiles on the space shuttle, which contain short fibers of pure SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> mixed with fibers of an aluminum–boron–silicate ceramic. These tiles are excellent thermal insulators and extremely light (their density is only about 0.2 g/cm<sup class="superscript">3</sup>). Although their surface reaches a temperature of about 1250°C during reentry into Earth’s atmosphere, the temperature of the underlying aluminum alloy skin stays below 200°C.</p>

Because of its use in a marine environment, it must also be resistant to impact and corrosion. A ceramic material provides rigidity but is brittle and therefore tends to break or crack under stress, such as when it impacts waves at high speeds. Superalloys provide strength and stability, but a superalloy is probably too heavy for this application. Depending on the selection of metals, it might not be resistant to corrosion in a marine environment either. Composite materials, however, provide strength, stiffness, and corrosion resistance; they are also lightweight materials. This is not a high-temperature application, so we do not need a metal-matrix composite or a ceramic-matrix composite. The best choice of material is a polymer-matrix composite with Kevlar fibers to increase the strength of the composite on impact.</p>
