    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s07_p01">The phenomenon of superconductivity was discovered by the Danish physicist H. Kamerlingh Onnes (1853–1926; Nobel Prize in Physics, 1913), who found a way to liquefy helium, which boils at 4.2 K and 1 atm pressure. To exploit the very low temperatures made possible by this new cryogenic fluid, he began a systematic study of the properties of metals, especially their electrical properties. Because the electrical resistance of a sample is technically easier to measure than its conductivity, Onnes measured the <em class="emphasis">resistivity</em> of his samples. The resistivity and conductivity of a material are inversely proportional:</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">BCS Theory</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s07_s01_p01">For many years, the phenomenon of superconductivity could not be satisfactorily explained by the laws of conventional physics. In the early 1950s, however, American physicists John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schrieffer formulated a theory for superconductivity that earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972. According to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">BCS theory</a><span class="glossdef">A theory used to explain the phenomenon of superconductivity.</span></span> (named for the initials of their last names), electrons are able to travel through a solid with zero resistance because of attractive interactions involving two electrons that are at some distance from each other. As one electron moves through the lattice, the surrounding nuclei are attracted to it. The motion of the nuclei can create a transient (short-lived) hole that pulls the second electron in the same direction as the first. The nuclei then return to their original positions to avoid colliding with the second electron as it approaches. The pairs of electrons, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cooper pairs</a><span class="glossdef">Pairs of electrons that migrate through a superconducting material as a unit.</span></span>, migrate through the crystal as a unit. The electrons in Cooper pairs change partners frequently, like dancers in a ballet.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s07_s01_p02">According to the BCS theory, as the temperature of the solid increases, the vibrations of the atoms in the lattice increase continuously, until eventually the electrons cannot avoid colliding with them. The collisions result in the loss of superconductivity at higher temperatures.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s07_s01_p03">The phenomenon of superconductivity suggested many exciting technological applications. For example, using superconducting wires in power cables would result in zero power losses, even over distances of hundreds of miles. Additionally, because superconductors expel magnetic fields, a combination of magnetic rails and superconducting wheels (or vice versa) could be used to produce <em class="emphasis">magnetic levitation</em> of, for example, a train over the track, resulting in friction-free transportation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s07_s01_p04">Unfortunately, for many years the only superconductors known had serious limitations, especially the need for very low temperatures, which required the use of expensive cryogenic fluids such as liquid He. In addition, the superconducting properties of many substances are destroyed by large electrical currents or even moderately large magnetic fields, making them useless for applications in power cables or high-field magnets. The ability of materials such as NbTi, NbSn, Nb<sub class="subscript">3</sub>Si, and Nb<sub class="subscript">3</sub>Ge to tolerate rather high magnetic fields, however, has led to a number of commercial applications of superconductors, including high-field magnets for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instruments in medicine, which, unlike x-rays, can detect small changes in soft tissues in the body.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">High-Temperature Superconductors</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s07_s02_p01">Because of these limitations, scientists continued to search for materials that exhibited superconductivity at temperatures greater than 77 K (the temperature of liquid nitrogen, the least expensive cryogenic fluid). In 1986, Johannes G. Bednorz and Karl A. Müller, working for IBM in Zurich, showed that certain mixed-metal oxides containing La, Ba, and Cu exhibited superconductivity above 30 K. These compounds had been prepared by French workers as potential solid catalysts some years earlier, but their electrical properties had never been examined at low temperatures. Although initially the scientific community was extremely skeptical, the compounds were so easy to prepare that the results were confirmed within a few weeks. These <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">high-temperature superconductors</a><span class="glossdef">A material that becomes a superconductor at temperatures greater than 30 K.</span></span> earned Bednorz and Müller the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1987. Subsequent research has produced new compounds with related structures that are superconducting at temperatures as high as 135 K. The best known of these was discovered by Paul Chu and Maw-Kuen Wu Jr. and is called the “Chu–Wu phase” or the 1-2-3 superconductor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s07_s02_p02">The formula for the 1-2-3 superconductor is YBa<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Cu<sub class="subscript">3</sub>O<sub class="subscript">7−</sub><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">x</em></sub>, where <em class="emphasis">x</em> is about 0.1 for samples that superconduct at about 95 K. If <em class="emphasis">x</em> ≈ 1.0, giving a formula of YBa<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Cu<sub class="subscript">3</sub>O<sub class="subscript">6</sub>, the material is an electrical insulator. The superconducting phase is thus a nonstoichiometric compound, with a fixed ratio of metal atoms but a variable oxygen content. The overall equation for the synthesis of this material is as follows:</p>
