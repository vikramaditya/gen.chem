    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s03_p01">Because nuclear reactions do not typically affect the valence electrons of the atom (although electron capture draws an electron from an orbital of the lowest energy level), they do not directly cause chemical changes. Nonetheless, the particles and the photons emitted during nuclear decay are very energetic, and they can indirectly produce chemical changes in the matter surrounding the nucleus that has decayed. For instance, an α particle is an ionized helium nucleus (He<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>) that can act as a powerful oxidant. In this section, we describe how radiation interacts with matter and the some of the chemical and biological effects of radiation.</p>

Instead, the kinetic energy of the radiation is transferred to the atom or molecule with which it collides, causing it to rotate, vibrate, or move more rapidly. Because this energy can be transferred to adjacent molecules or ions in the form of heat, many radioactive substances are warm to the touch. Highly radioactive elements such as polonium, for example, have been used as heat sources in the US space program. As long as the intensity of the nonionizing radiation is not great enough to cause overheating, it is relatively harmless, and its effects can be neutralized by cooling.</p>

Because of its high charge and mass, α radiation interacts strongly with matter. Consequently, it does not penetrate deeply into an object, and it can be stopped by a piece of paper, clothing, or skin. In contrast, γ rays, with no charge and essentially no mass, do not interact strongly with matter and penetrate deeply into most objects, including the human body. Several inches of lead or more than 12 inches of special concrete are needed to completely stop γ rays. Because β particles are intermediate in mass and charge between α particles and γ rays, their interaction with matter is also intermediate. Beta particles readily penetrate paper or skin, but they can be stopped by a piece of wood or a relatively thin sheet of metal.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s03_s02_p03">Because of their great penetrating ability, γ rays are by far the most dangerous type of radiation when they come from a source <em class="emphasis">outside</em> the body. Alpha particles, however, are the most damaging if their source is <em class="emphasis">inside</em> the body because internal tissues absorb all of their energy. Thus danger from radiation depends strongly on the type of radiation emitted and the extent of exposure, which allows scientists to safely handle many radioactive materials if they take precautions to avoid, for example, inhaling fine particulate dust that contains alpha emitters.

His family moved to the Netherlands where he showed no particular aptitude in school, but where he was fond of roaming the countryside. Röntgen was expelled from technical school in Utrecht after being unjustly accused of drawing a caricature of one of the teachers. He began studying mechanical engineering in Zurich, which he could enter without having the credentials of a regular student, and received a PhD at the University of Zurich in 1869. In 1876 he became professor of physics.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s03_s03_p04">The third major component of background radiation is <em class="emphasis">terrestrial radiation</em>, which is due to the remnants of radioactive elements that were present on primordial Earth and their decay products.

The amount of background radiation from these sources is about the same as that from cosmic rays (approximately 30 mrem/yr). These isotopes are also found in small amounts in building materials derived from rocks and minerals, which significantly increases the radiation exposure for people who live in brick or concrete-block houses (60–160 mrem/yr) instead of houses made of wood (10–20 mrem/yr). Our tissues also absorb radiation (about 40 mrem/yr) from naturally occurring radioactive elements that are present in our bodies. For example, the average adult contains about 140 g of potassium as the K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ion. Naturally occurring potassium contains 0.0117% <sup class="superscript">40</sup>K, which decays by emitting both a β particle and a γ ray.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s03_s03_p06">Because radon is a dense gas, it tends to accumulate in enclosed spaces such as basements, especially in locations where the soil contains greater-than-average amounts of naturally occurring uranium minerals. Under most conditions, radioactive decay of radon poses no problems because of the very short range of the emitted α particle. If an atom of radon happens to be in your lungs when it decays, however, the chemically reactive daughter isotope polonium-218 can become irreversibly bound to molecules in the lung tissue. Subsequent decay of <sup class="superscript">218</sup>Po releases an α particle directly into one of the cells lining the lung, and the resulting damage can eventually cause lung cancer. The <sup class="superscript">218</sup>Po isotope is also readily absorbed by particles in cigarette smoke, which adhere to the surface of the lungs and can hold the radioactive isotope in place. Recent estimates suggest that radon exposure is a contributing factor in about 15% of the deaths due to lung cancer. Because of the potential health problem radon poses, many states require houses to be tested for radon before they can be sold. By current estimates, radon accounts for more than half of the radiation exposure of a typical adult in the United States.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Artificial Sources of Radiation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s03_s04_p01">In addition to naturally occurring background radiation, humans are exposed to small amounts of radiation from a variety of artificial sources. The most important of these are the x-rays used for diagnostic purposes in medicine and dentistry, which are photons with much lower energy than γ rays. A single chest x-ray provides a radiation dose of about 10 mrem, and a dental x-ray about 2–3 mrem. Other minor sources include television screens and computer monitors with cathode-ray tubes, which also produce x-rays. Luminescent paints for watch dials originally used radium, a highly toxic alpha emitter if ingested by those painting the dials. Radium was replaced by tritium (<sup class="superscript">3</sup>H) and promethium (<sup class="superscript">147</sup>Pr), which emit low-energy β particles that are absorbed by the watch crystal or the glass covering the instrument. Radiation exposure from television screens, monitors, and luminescent dials totals about 2 mrem/yr. Residual fallout from previous atmospheric nuclear-weapons testing is estimated to account for about twice this amount, and the nuclear power industry accounts for less than 1 mrem/yr (about the same as a single 4 h jet flight).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s03_s05_p01">One of the more controversial public policy issues debated today is whether the radiation exposure from artificial sources, when combined with exposure from natural sources, poses a significant risk to human health. The effects of single radiation doses of different magnitudes on humans are listed in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch20_s03_s05_t01">Table 20.4 "The Effects of a Single Radiation Dose on a 70 kg Human"</a>. Because of the many factors involved in radiation exposure (length of exposure, intensity of the source, and energy and type of particle), it is difficult to quantify the specific dangers of one radioisotope versus another. Nonetheless, some general conclusions regarding the effects of radiation exposure are generally accepted as valid.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s03_s05_p02">Radiation doses of 600 rem and higher are invariably fatal, while a dose of 500 rem kills half the exposed subjects within 30 days. Smaller doses (≤ 50 rem) appear to cause only limited health effects, even though they correspond to tens of years of natural radiation. This does not, however, mean that such doses have no ill effects; they may cause long-term health problems, such as cancer or genetic changes that affect offspring. The possible detrimental effects of the much smaller doses attributable to artificial sources (&lt; 100 mrem/yr) are more difficult to assess.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s03_s05_p03">The tissues most affected by large, whole-body exposures are bone marrow, intestinal tissue, hair follicles, and reproductive organs, all of which contain rapidly dividing cells. The susceptibility of rapidly dividing cells to radiation exposure explains why cancers are often treated by radiation. Because cancer cells divide faster than normal cells, they are destroyed preferentially by radiation. Long-term radiation-exposure studies on fruit flies show a linear relationship between the number of genetic defects and both the magnitude of the dose and the exposure time. In contrast, similar studies on mice show a much lower number of defects when a given dose of radiation is spread out over a long period of time rather than received all at once. Both patterns are plotted in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch20_s03_s05_f01">Figure 20.14 "Two Possible Relationships between the Number of Genetic Defects and Radiation Exposure"</a>, but which of the two is applicable to humans? According to one hypothesis, mice have very low risk from low doses because their bodies have ways of dealing with the damage caused by natural radiation. At much higher doses, however, their natural repair mechanisms are overwhelmed, leading to irreversible damage. Because mice are biochemically much more similar to humans than are fruit flies, many scientists believe that this model also applies to humans. In contrast, the linear model assumes that <em class="emphasis">all</em> exposure to radiation is intrinsically damaging and suggests that stringent regulation of low-level radiation exposure is necessary. Which view is more accurate? The answer—while yet unknown—has extremely important consequences for regulating radiation exposure.</p>

            <p class="para">Studies on fruit flies show a linear relationship between the number of genetic defects and the magnitude of the radiation dose and exposure time, which is consistent with a cumulative effect of radiation. In contrast, studies on mice show an S-shaped curve, which suggests that the number of defects is lower when radiation exposure occurs over a longer time. Which of these relationships is more applicable to humans is a matter of considerable debate.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch20_s03_s05_p04">The effects of radiation on matter depend on the energy of the radiation. <strong class="emphasis bold">Nonionizing radiation</strong> is relatively low in energy, and the energy is transferred to matter in the form of heat. <strong class="emphasis bold">Ionizing radiation</strong> is relatively high in energy, and when it collides with an atom, it can completely remove an electron to form a positively charged ion that can damage biological tissues. Alpha particles do not penetrate very far into matter, whereas γ rays penetrate more deeply. Common units of radiation exposure, or dose, are the <strong class="emphasis bold">roentgen (R)</strong>, the amount of energy absorbed by dry air, and the <strong class="emphasis bold">rad (radiation absorbed dose)</strong>, the amount of radiation that produces 0.01 J of energy in 1 kg of matter. The <strong class="emphasis bold">rem (roentgen equivalent in man)</strong> measures the actual amount of tissue damage caused by a given amount of radiation. Natural sources of radiation include <em class="emphasis">cosmic radiation</em>, consisting of high-energy particles and γ rays emitted by the sun and other stars; <em class="emphasis">cosmogenic radiation</em>, which is produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with gases in the upper atmosphere; and <em class="emphasis">terrestrial radiation</em>, from radioactive elements present on primordial Earth and their decay products. The risks of ionizing radiation depend on the intensity of the radiation, the mode of exposure, and the duration of the exposure.</p>
