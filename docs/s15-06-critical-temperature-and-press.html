As we increase the temperature of a gas, liquefaction becomes more and more difficult because higher and higher pressures are required to overcome the increased kinetic energy of the molecules. In fact, for every substance, there is some temperature above which the gas can no longer be liquefied, regardless of pressure. This temperature is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">critical temperature (<em class="emphasis">T</em><sub class="subscript">c</sub>)</a><span class="glossdef">The highest temperature at which a substance can exist as a liquid, regardless of the applied pressure.</span></span>, the highest temperature at which a substance can exist as a liquid. Above the critical temperature, the molecules have too much kinetic energy for the intermolecular attractive forces to hold them together in a separate liquid phase. Instead, the substance forms a single phase that completely occupies the volume of the container. Substances with strong intermolecular forces tend to form a liquid phase over a very large temperature range and therefore have high critical temperatures. Conversely, substances with weak intermolecular interactions have relatively low critical temperatures. Each substance also has a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">critical pressure (<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">c</sub>)</a><span class="glossdef">The minimum pressure needed to liquefy a substance at its critical temperature.</span></span>, the minimum pressure needed to liquefy it at the critical temperature.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Supercritical Fluids</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s06_s01_p01">To understand what happens at the critical point, consider the effects of temperature and pressure on the densities of liquids and gases, respectively. As the temperature of a liquid increases, its density decreases. As the pressure of a gas increases, its density increases. At the critical point, the liquid and gas phases have exactly the same density, and only a single phase exists. This single phase is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">supercritical fluid</a><span class="glossdef">The single, dense fluid phase that exists above the critical temperature of a substance.</span></span>, which exhibits many of the properties of a gas but has a density more typical of a liquid. For example, the density of water at its critical point (<em class="emphasis">T</em> = 374°C, <em class="emphasis">P</em> = 217.7 atm) is 0.32 g/mL, about one-third that of liquid water at room temperature but much greater than that of water vapor under most conditions. The transition between a liquid/gas mixture and a supercritical phase is demonstrated for a sample of benzene in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s06_s01_f01">Figure 11.21 "Supercritical Benzene"</a>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s06_s01_p02">In the last few years, supercritical fluids have evolved from laboratory curiosities to substances with important commercial applications. For example, carbon dioxide has a low critical temperature (31°C), a comparatively low critical pressure (73 atm), and low toxicity, making it easy to contain and relatively safe to manipulate. Because many substances are quite soluble in supercritical CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, commercial processes that use it as a solvent are now well established in the oil industry, the food industry, and others. Supercritical CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> is pumped into oil wells that are no longer producing much oil to dissolve the residual oil in the underground reservoirs. The less-viscous solution is then pumped to the surface, where the oil can be recovered by evaporation (and recycling) of the CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>. In the food, flavor, and fragrance industry, supercritical CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> is used to extract components from natural substances for use in perfumes, remove objectionable organic acids from hops prior to making beer, and selectively extract caffeine from whole coffee beans without removing important flavor components. The latter process was patented in 1974, and now virtually all decaffeinated coffee is produced this way. The earlier method used volatile organic solvents such as methylene chloride (dichloromethane [CH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Cl<sub class="subscript">2</sub>], boiling point = 40°C), which is difficult to remove completely from the beans and is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals at high doses.</p>

In N<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O, a slightly polar substance, weak dipole–dipole interactions and London dispersion forces are important. Butane (C<sub class="subscript">4</sub>H<sub class="subscript">10</sub>) and pentane (C<sub class="subscript">5</sub>H<sub class="subscript">12</sub>) are larger, nonpolar molecules that exhibit only London dispersion forces.

The only remaining question is whether N<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O is polar enough to have stronger intermolecular interactions than pentane or butane.

If we heated a sample of solid NaCl to its melting point of 801°C, for example, it would melt to give a stable liquid that conducts electricity. The characteristics of molten salts other than electrical conductivity are their high heat capacity, ability to attain very high temperatures (over 700°C) as a liquid, and utility as solvents because of their relatively low toxicity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s06_s02_p02">Molten salts have many uses in industry and the laboratory. For example, in solar power towers in the desert of California, mirrors collect and focus sunlight to melt a mixture of sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate. The heat stored in the molten salt is used to produce steam that drives a steam turbine and a generator, thereby producing electricity from the sun for southern California.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s06_s02_p03">Due to their low toxicity and high thermal efficiency, molten salts have also been used in nuclear reactors to enable operation at temperatures greater than 750°C.

By varying the cation and the anion, chemists can tailor the liquid to specific needs, such as using a solvent in a given reaction or extracting specific molecules from a solution. For example, an ionic liquid consisting of a bulky cation and anions that bind metal contaminants such as mercury and cadmium ions can remove those toxic metals from the environment. A similar approach has been applied to removing uranium and americium from water contaminated by nuclear waste.</p>
