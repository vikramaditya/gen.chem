        <li>It is impossible to obtain any substance in 100% pure form. Some impurities are always present.</li>
        <li>Even if a substance were 100% pure, forming a perfect crystal would require cooling the liquid phase infinitely slowly to allow all atoms, ions, or molecules to find their proper positions. Cooling at more realistic rates usually results in one or more components being trapped in the “wrong” place in a lattice or in areas where two lattices that grew separately intersect.</li>
        <li>Applying an external stress to a crystal, such as a hammer blow, can cause microscopic regions of the lattice to move with respect to the rest, thus resulting in imperfect alignment.</li>

To illustrate the process, suppose you have a heavy rug that is lying a few inches off-center on a nonskid pad. To move the rug to its proper place, you could pick up one end and pull it. Because of the large area of contact between the rug and the pad, however, they will probably move as a unit. Alternatively, you could pick up the rug and try to set it back down exactly where you want it, but that requires a great deal of effort (and probably at least one extra person). An easier solution is to create a small wrinkle at one end of the rug (an edge dislocation) and gradually push the wrinkle across, resulting in a net movement of the rug as a whole (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_f02">Figure 12.17 "The Role of Dislocation in the Motion of One Planar Object across Another"</a>). Moving the wrinkle requires only a small amount of energy because only a small part of the rug is actually moving at any one time. Similarly, in a solid, the contacts between layers are broken in only one place at a time, which facilitates the deformation process.</p>

Similarly, intersecting dislocations in a solid prevent them from moving, thereby increasing the mechanical strength of the material. In fact, one of the major goals of materials science is to find ways to pin dislocations to strengthen or harden a material.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_p04">Pinning can also be achieved by introducing selected impurities in appropriate amounts. Substitutional impurities that are a mismatch in size to the host prevent dislocations from migrating smoothly along a plane. Generally, the higher the concentration of impurities, the more effectively they block migration, and the stronger the material. For example, bronze, which contains about 20% tin and 80% copper by mass, produces a much harder and sharper weapon than does either pure tin or pure copper. Similarly, pure gold is too soft to make durable jewelry, so most gold jewelry contains 75% (18 carat) or 58% (14 carat) gold by mass, with the remainder consisting of copper, silver, or both.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_p05">If an interstitial impurity forms polar covalent bonds to the host atoms, the layers are prevented from sliding past one another, even when only a small amount of the impurity is present. For example, because iron forms polar covalent bonds to carbon, the strongest steels need to contain only about 1% carbon by mass to substantially increase their strength (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s01_t01">Table 12.3 "Compositions, Properties, and Uses of Some Types of Steel"</a>).</p>

Bending an object made of the low-temperature (kinked) phase creates defects that change the pattern of kinks within the structure. If the object is heated to a temperature greater than about 50°C, the material undergoes a transition to the cubic high-temperature phase, causing the object to return to its original shape. The shape of the object above 50°C is controlled by a complex set of defects and dislocations that can be relaxed or changed only by the thermal motion of the atoms. </p>

The three transition elements (Mn, Ni, and Cr) lie near Fe in the periodic table, so they should be similar to Fe in chemical properties and atomic size (atomic radius = 125 pm). Hence they almost certainly will substitute for iron in the Fe lattice. Carbon is a second-period element that is nonmetallic and much smaller (atomic radius = 77 pm) than iron. Carbon will therefore tend to occupy interstitial sites in the iron lattice. Phosphorus and silicon are chemically quite different from iron (phosphorus is a nonmetal, and silicon is a semimetal), even though they are similar in size (atomic radii of 106 and 111 pm, respectively). Thus they are unlikely to be substitutional impurities in the iron lattice or fit into interstitial sites, but they could aggregate into layers that would constitute plane defects.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s03_p01">All the defects and impurities described for metals are seen in ionic and molecular compounds as well. Because ionic compounds contain both cations and anions rather than only neutral atoms, however, they exhibit additional types of defects that are not possible in metals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s03_p02">The most straightforward variant is a substitutional impurity in which a cation or an anion is replaced by another of similar charge and size. For example, Br<sup class="superscript">−</sup> can substitute for Cl<sup class="superscript">−</sup>, so tiny amounts of Br<sup class="superscript">−</sup> are usually present in a chloride salt such as CaCl<sub class="subscript">2</sub> or BaCl<sub class="subscript">2</sub>. If the substitutional impurity and the host have <em class="emphasis">different</em> charges, however, the situation becomes more complicated. Suppose, for example, that Sr<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> (ionic radius = 118 pm) substitutes for K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> (ionic radius = 138 pm) in KCl. Because the ions are approximately the same size, Sr<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> should fit nicely into the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice of KCl. The difference in charge, however, must somehow be compensated for so that electrical neutrality is preserved. The simplest way is for a second K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ion to be lost elsewhere in the crystal, producing a vacancy. Thus substitution of K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> by Sr<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> in KCl results in the introduction of <em class="emphasis">two</em> defects: a site in which an Sr<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ion occupies a K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> position and a vacant cation site. Substitutional impurities whose charges do not match the host’s are often introduced intentionally to produce compounds with specific properties (see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12_s07#averill_1.0-ch12_s07">Section 12.7 "Superconductors"</a>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s03_p03">Virtually all the colored gems used in jewelry are due to substitutional impurities in simple oxide structures. For example, α-Al<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">3</sub>, a hard white solid called <em class="emphasis">corundum</em> that is used as an abrasive in fine sandpaper, is the primary component, or <em class="emphasis">matrix</em>, of a wide variety of gems. Because many trivalent transition metal ions have ionic radii only a little larger than the radius of Al<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> (ionic radius = 53.5 pm), they can replace Al<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> in the octahedral holes of the oxide lattice. Substituting small amounts of Cr<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> ions (ionic radius = 75 pm) for Al<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> gives the deep red color of ruby, and a mixture of impurities (Fe<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>, Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup>, and Ti<sup class="superscript">4+</sup>) gives the deep blue of sapphire. True amethyst contains small amounts of Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> in an SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> (quartz) matrix.

For example, Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> ions are responsible for the yellow color of topaz and the violet color of amethyst.

In response to an applied voltage, the cations in solid electrolytes can diffuse rapidly through the lattice via octahedral holes, creating Frenkel defects as the cations migrate. Sodium–sulfur batteries use a solid Al<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">3</sub> electrolyte with small amounts of solid Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O.

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s04_s04_p04">Real crystals contain large numbers of <strong class="emphasis bold">defects</strong>. Defects may affect only a single point in the lattice (a <strong class="emphasis bold">point defect</strong>), a row of lattice points (a <strong class="emphasis bold">line defect</strong>), or a plane of atoms (a <strong class="emphasis bold">plane defect</strong>). A point defect can be an atom missing from a site in the crystal (a <strong class="emphasis bold">vacancy</strong>) or an impurity atom that occupies either a normal lattice site (a <strong class="emphasis bold">substitutional impurity</strong>) or a hole in the lattice between atoms (an <strong class="emphasis bold">interstitial impurity</strong>). In an <strong class="emphasis bold">edge dislocation</strong>, an extra plane of atoms is inserted into part of the crystal lattice. Multiple defects can be introduced into materials so that the presence of one defect prevents the motion of another, in a process called <strong class="emphasis bold">pinning</strong>. Because defect motion tends to stop at <strong class="emphasis bold">grain boundaries</strong>, controlling the size of the grains in a material controls its mechanical properties. In addition, a process called <strong class="emphasis bold">work hardening</strong> introduces defects to toughen metals. <strong class="emphasis bold">Schottky defects</strong> are a coupled pair of vacancies—one cation and one anion—that maintains electrical neutrality. A <strong class="emphasis bold">Frenkel defect</strong> is an ion that occupies an incorrect site in the lattice. Cations in such compounds are often able to move rapidly from one site in the crystal to another, resulting in high electrical conductivity in the solid material. Such compounds are called <strong class="emphasis bold">solid electrolytes</strong>. <strong class="emphasis bold">Nonstoichiometric compounds</strong> have variable stoichiometries over a given range with no dramatic change in crystal structure. This behavior is due to a large number of vacancies or substitutions of one ion by another ion with a different charge.</p>

Larger impurity atoms are likely to form “bumps” or kinks that will make it harder for layers of atoms to move across one another. Interstitial atoms that form polar covalent bonds with the metal atoms tend to occupy spaces between the layers; they act as a “glue” that holds layers of metal atoms together, which greatly decreases the ductility.</p>

                        <p class="para">The lower charge of K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> makes it the best candidate for inducing an oxide vacancy, even though its ionic radius is substantially larger than that of Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>. Substituting two K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ions for two Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ions will decrease the total positive charge by two, and an oxide vacancy will maintain electrical neutrality. For example, if 10% of the Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ions are replaced by K<sup class="superscript">+</sup>, we can represent the change as going from Ca<sub class="subscript">20</sub>O<sub class="subscript">20</sub> to K<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Ca<sub class="subscript">18</sub>O<sub class="subscript">20</sub>, which has a net charge of +2. Loss of one oxide ion would give a composition of K<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Ca<sub class="subscript">18</sub>O<sub class="subscript">19</sub>, which is electrically neutral.</p>
