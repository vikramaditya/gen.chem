    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s02_p01">In earlier discussions of organic compounds, we focused on differences in how the functional groups were connected to the carbon framework. Differences in connectivity resulted in different chemical compounds with different names. You learned, for example, that although 1-propanol (<em class="emphasis">n</em>-propanol) and 2-propanol (isopropanol) have the same molecular formula (C<sub class="subscript">3</sub>H<sub class="subscript">8</sub>O), they have different physical and chemical properties. Just as with metal complexes, compounds that have the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms are called isomers. (For more information on metal complexes, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch23#averill_1.0-ch23">Chapter 23 "The "</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch23_s04#averill_1.0-ch23_s04">Section 23.4 "Coordination Compounds"</a>.) In this section, we describe various types of isomers, beginning with those whose three-dimensional structures differ only as the result of rotation about a C–C bond.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s01_p01">The C–C single bonds in ethane, propane, and other alkanes are formed by the overlap of an <em class="emphasis">sp</em><sup class="superscript">3</sup> hybrid orbital on one carbon atom with an <em class="emphasis">sp</em><sup class="superscript">3</sup> hybrid orbital on another carbon atom, forming a σ bond (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s01_f01">Figure 24.3 "Carbon–Carbon Bonding in Alkanes"</a>).

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s01_p03">The simplest alkane to have a conformational isomer is ethane. Differences between the conformations of ethane are depicted especially clearly in drawings called <em class="emphasis">Newman projections</em>, such as those shown in part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s01_f02">Figure 24.4 "Eclipsed and Staggered Conformations of Ethane"</a>. In a Newman projection, the ethane molecule is viewed along the C–C axis, with the carbon that is in front shown as a vertex and the carbon that is in back shown as a circle. The three hydrogen atoms nearest the viewer are shown bonded to the front carbon, and the three hydrogen atoms farthest from the viewer are shown bonded to the circle. In one extreme, called the <em class="emphasis">eclipsed conformation</em>, the C–H bonds on adjacent carbon atoms lie in the same plane. In the other extreme, called the <em class="emphasis">staggered conformation</em>, the hydrogen atoms are positioned as far from one another as possible. Rotation about the C–C bond produces an infinite number of conformations between these two extremes, but the staggered conformation is the most stable because it minimizes electrostatic repulsion between the hydrogen atoms on adjacent carbons.</p>

            <p class="para">(a) In a Newman projection, the molecule is viewed along a C–C axis. The carbon in front is represented as a vertex, whereas the carbon that is bonded to it is represented as a circle. In ethane, the C–H bonds to each carbon are positioned at 120° from each other. In the fully eclipsed conformation, the C–H bonds on adjacent carbon atoms are parallel and lie in the same plane. In the staggered conformation, the hydrogen atoms are positioned as far apart as possible. (b) The eclipsed conformation is 12.6 kJ/mol higher in energy than the staggered conformation because of electrostatic repulsion between the hydrogen atoms. An infinite number of conformations of intermediate energy exist between the two extremes.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s01_p04">In a Newman projection, the angles between adjacent C–H bonds on the same carbon are drawn at 120°, although H–C–H angles in alkanes are actually tetrahedral angles of 109.5°, which for chains of more than three carbon atoms results in a <em class="emphasis">kinked</em> structure. (For more information on bond angles and molecular modeling, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch02#averill_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Molecules, Ions, and Chemical Formulas"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch02_s01#averill_1.0-ch02_s01">Section 2.1 "Chemical Compounds"</a>.) Despite this three-dimensional inaccuracy, Newman projections are useful for predicting the relative stability of conformational isomers. As shown in part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s01_f02">Figure 24.4 "Eclipsed and Staggered Conformations of Ethane"</a>, the higher energy of the eclipsed conformation represents an energy barrier of 12.6 kJ/mol that must be overcome for rotation about the C–C bond to occur. This barrier is so low, however, that rotation about the C–C bond in ethane is very fast at room temperature and occurs several million times per second for each molecule.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s01_p05">Longer-chain alkanes can also be represented by Newman projections. In more complex alkanes and alkane derivatives, rotation can occur about <em class="emphasis">each</em> C–C bond in a molecule. Newman projections are therefore useful for revealing <em class="emphasis">steric barriers</em> to rotation at a particular C–C bond due to the presence of bulky substituents. <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s01_f03">Figure 24.5 "Potential Energy Plot and Newman Projections of Eclipsed and Staggered Conformations of "</a> shows a plot of potential energy versus the angle of rotation about the central C–C bond (between carbon atoms 2 and 3) of <em class="emphasis">n</em>-butane (C<sub class="subscript">4</sub>H<sub class="subscript">10</sub>). The structure that minimizes electrostatic repulsion is the one in which the methyl groups, corresponding to carbon atoms 1 and 4, are as far apart as possible; that is, the staggered conformation. Notice that because the substituents on C2 and C3 in <em class="emphasis">n</em>-butane are not all the same, energetically nonequivalent eclipsed and staggered conformations are possible; most molecules interconvert rapidly between these conformations by a series of simple rotations.</p>

            <p class="para">In these projections, the molecule is viewed along the C2–C3 axis. The least stable structure is the eclipsed conformation in which the two methyl groups (C1 and C4) are adjacent to each other. The most stable structure is the staggered conformation in which the methyl groups are as far apart as possible. Because the substituents on each central carbon atom are not all the same, a 120° rotation about the C2–C3 bond generates energetically nonequivalent eclipsed and staggered conformations.</p>

Simple rotation about a C–C σ bond in an alkene, for example, cannot occur because of the presence of the π bond.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Interactions of Enantiomers with Other Chiral Molecules</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s03_s02_p01">In living organisms, virtually every molecule that contains a chiral center is found as a single enantiomer, not a racemic mixture. At the molecular level, our bodies are chiral and interact differently with the individual enantiomers of a particular compound. For example, the two enantiomers of carvone produce very different responses in humans: (−)-carvone is the substance responsible for the smell of spearment oil, and (+)-carvone—the major flavor component of caraway seeds—is responsible for the characteristic aroma of rye bread.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s03_s02_p02">A pharmaceutical example of a chiral compound is ibuprofen, a common analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent that is the active ingredient in pain relievers such as Motrin and Advil (<a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch24_s05#averill_1.0-ch24_s05_s02_f01">Figure 24.16 "Biologically Active Substituted Arenes"</a>). The drug is sold as a racemic mixture that takes approximately 38 minutes to achieve its full effect in relieving pain and swelling in an adult human. Because only the (+) enantiomer is active in humans, however, the same mass of medication would relieve symptoms in only about 12 minutes if it consisted of only the (+) enantiomer. Unfortunately, isolating only the (+) enantiomer would substantially increase the cost of the drug. Conversion of the (−) to (+) enantiomer in the human body accounts for the delay in feeling the full effects of the drug. A racemic mixture of another drug, the sedative thalidomide, was sold in Europe from 1956 to the early 1960s. It was prescribed to treat nausea during pregnancy, but unfortunately only the (+) enantiomer was safe for that purpose. The (−) enantiomer was discovered to be a relatively potent <em class="emphasis">teratogen</em>, a substance that causes birth defects, which caused the children of many women who had taken thalidomide to be born with missing or undeveloped limbs. As a result, thalidomide was quickly banned for this use. It is currently used to treat leprosy, however, and it has also shown promise as a treatment for AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s03_s02_p03">These examples dramatically illustrate the point that the biological activities of enantiomers may be very different. But how can two molecules that differ only by being nonsuperimposable mirror images cause such different responses? The biological effects of many substances—including molecules such as carvone that have a scent and drugs such as ibuprofen and thalidomide—depend on their interaction with chiral sites on specific receptor proteins. As schematically illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s03_s02_f01">Figure 24.10 "The Interaction of Chiral Molecules with Biological Receptors"</a>, only one enantiomer of a chiral substance interacts with a particular receptor, thereby initiating a response. The other enantiomer may not bind at all, or it may bind to <em class="emphasis">another</em> receptor, producing a different response.</p>

                <p class="para">Only one enantiomer of a chiral molecule fits into a chiral receptor site, which typically is a small portion of a large protein. The binding of a molecule to its receptor elicits a characteristic response. The other enantiomer cannot fit into the same site and thus elicits no response. It may, however, produce a different response by binding to another site.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
                <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s02_s03_s02_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Isomers</strong> are different compounds that have the same molecular formula. For an organic compound, rotation about a σ bond can produce different three-dimensional structures called <strong class="emphasis bold">conformational isomers (or conformers)</strong>. In a Newman projection, which represents the view along a C–C axis, the eclipsed conformation has the C–H bonds on adjacent carbon atoms parallel to each other and in the same plane, representing one conformational extreme. In the staggered conformation, the opposite extreme, the hydrogen atoms are as far from one another as possible. Electrostatic repulsions are minimized in the staggered conformation. <strong class="emphasis bold">Structural isomers</strong> differ in the connectivity of the atoms. Structures that have the same connectivity but whose components differ in their orientations in space are called <strong class="emphasis bold">stereoisomers</strong>. Stereoisomers can be geometric isomers, which differ in the placement of substituents in a rigid molecule, or optical isomers, nonsuperimposable mirror images. Molecules that are nonsuperimposable mirror images are chiral molecules. A molecule and its nonsuperimposable mirror image are called enantiomers. These differ in their interaction with plane-polarized light, light that oscillates in only one direction. A compound is optically active if its solution rotates plane-polarized light in only one direction and optically inactive if its rotations cancel to produce no net rotation. A clockwise rotation is called dextrorotatory and is indicated in the compound’s name by (+), whereas a counterclockwise rotation is called levorotatory, designated by (−). The <strong class="emphasis bold">specific rotation</strong> is the amount (in degrees) by which the plane of polarized light is rotated when light is passed through a solution containing 1.0 g of solute per 1.0 mL of solvent in a tube 10.0 cm long. A solution that contains equal concentrations of each enantiomer in a pair is a racemic mixture; such solutions are optically inactive.</p>
