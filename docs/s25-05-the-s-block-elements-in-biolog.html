    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch21_s05_p01">The <em class="emphasis">s</em>-block elements play important roles in biological systems. Covalent hydrides, for example, are the building blocks of organic compounds, and other compounds and ions containing <em class="emphasis">s</em>-block elements are found in tissues and cellular fluids. In this section, we describe some ways in which biology depends on the properties of the group 1 and group 2 elements.</p>
    <div class="section" id="averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Covalent Hydrides</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s01_p01">There are three major classes of hydrides—covalent, ionic, and metallic—but only covalent hydrides occur in living cells and have any biochemical significance. As you learned in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch07#averill_1.0-ch07">Chapter 7 "The Periodic Table and Periodic Trends"</a>, carbon and hydrogen have similar electronegativities, and the C–H bonds in organic molecules are strong and essentially nonpolar. Little acid–base chemistry is involved in the cleavage or formation of these bonds. In contrast, because hydrogen is less electronegative than oxygen and nitrogen (symbolized by Z), the H–Z bond in the hydrides of these elements is polarized (H<sup class="superscript">δ+</sup>–Z<sup class="superscript">δ−</sup>). Consequently, the hydrogen atoms in these H–Z bonds are relatively acidic. Moreover, S–H bonds are relatively weak due to poor <em class="emphasis">s</em> orbital overlap, so they are readily cleaved to give a proton. Hydrides in which H is bonded to O, N, or S atoms are therefore polar, hydrophilic molecules that form hydrogen bonds. They also undergo acid–base reactions by transferring a proton.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s01_p03">Hydrogen bonds are crucial in biochemistry, in part because they help hold proteins in their biologically active folded structures. Hydrogen bonds also connect the two intertwining strands of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the substance that contains the genetic code for all organisms. (For more information on DNA, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch24#averill_1.0-ch24">Chapter 24 "Organic Compounds"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch24_s06#averill_1.0-ch24_s06">Section 24.6 "The Molecules of Life"</a>.) Because hydrogen bonds are easier to break than the covalent bonds that form the individual DNA strands, the two intertwined strands can be separated to give intact single strands, which is essential for the duplication of genetic information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s01_p04">In addition to the importance of hydrogen bonds in biochemical molecules, the extensive hydrogen-bonding network in water is one of the keys to the existence of life on our planet. Based on its molecular mass, water should be a gas at room temperature (20°C), but the strong intermolecular interactions in liquid water greatly increase its boiling point. Hydrogen bonding also produces the relatively open molecular arrangement found in ice, which causes ice to be less dense than water. Because ice floats on the surface of water, it creates an insulating layer that allows aquatic organisms to survive during cold winter months.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s01_p05">These same strong intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions are also responsible for the high heat capacity of water and its high heat of fusion. A great deal of energy must be removed from water for it to freeze. Consequently, as noted in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05#averill_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions"</a>, large bodies of water act as “thermal buffers” that have a stabilizing effect on the climate of adjacent land areas. Perhaps the most striking example of this effect is the fact that humans can live comfortably at very high latitudes. For example, palm trees grow in southern England at the same latitude (51°N) as the southern end of frigid Hudson Bay and northern Newfoundland in North America, areas known more for their moose populations than for their tropical vegetation. Warm water from the Gulf Stream current in the Atlantic Ocean flows clockwise from the tropical climate at the equator past the eastern coast of the United States and then turns toward England, where heat stored in the water is released. The temperate climate of Europe is largely attributable to the thermal properties of water.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Macrominerals</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s02_p01">The members of group 1 and group 2 that are present in the largest amounts in organisms are sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium, all of which form monatomic cations with a charge of +1 (group 1, M<sup class="superscript">+</sup>) or +2 (group 2, M<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>). Biologically, these elements can be classified as <em class="emphasis">macrominerals</em> (<a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01_s08#averill_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_t01">Table 1.6 "Approximate Elemental Composition of a Typical 70 kg Human"</a>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s02_p02">For example, calcium is found in the form of relatively insoluble calcium salts that are used as structural materials in many organisms. Hydroxyapatite [Ca<sub class="subscript">5</sub>(PO<sub class="subscript">4</sub>)<sub class="subscript">3</sub>OH] is the major component of bones, calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>) is the major component of the shells of mollusks and the eggs of birds and reptiles, and calcium oxalate (CaO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>CCO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>) is found in many plants. Because calcium and strontium have similar sizes and charge-to-radius ratios, small quantities of strontium are always found in bone and other calcium-containing structural materials. Normally this is not a problem because the Sr<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ions occupy sites that would otherwise be occupied by Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ions. When trace amounts of radioactive <sup class="superscript">90</sup>Sr are released into the atmosphere from nuclear weapons tests or a nuclear accident, however, the radioactive strontium eventually reaches the ground, where it is taken up by plants that are consumed by dairy cattle. The isotope then becomes concentrated in cow’s milk, along with calcium. Because radioactive strontium coprecipitates with calcium in the hydroxyapatite that surrounds the bone marrow (where white blood cells are produced), children, who typically ingest more cow’s milk than adults, are at substantially increased risk for leukemia, a type of cancer characterized by the overproduction of white blood cells.</p>
        <div class="section" id="averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Ion Transport</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s02_s01_p01">The Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup>, K<sup class="superscript">+</sup>, Mg<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>, and Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ions are important components of intracellular and extracellular fluids. Both Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup> and Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> are found primarily in <em class="emphasis">extra</em>cellular fluids, such as blood plasma, whereas K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> and Mg<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> are found primarily in <em class="emphasis">intra</em>cellular fluids. Substantial inputs of energy are required to establish and maintain these concentration gradients and prevent the system from reaching equilibrium. Thus energy is needed to transport each ion across the cell membrane toward the side with the higher concentration. The biological machines that are responsible for the selective transport of these metal ions are complex assemblies of proteins called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ion pumps</a><span class="glossdef">A complex assembly of proteins that selectively transport ions across cell membranes by their high affinity for ions of a certain charge and radius.</span></span>. Ion pumps recognize and discriminate between metal ions in the same way that crown ethers and cryptands do, with a high affinity for ions of a certain charge and radius.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s02_s01_p02">Defects in the ion pumps or their control mechanisms can result in major health problems. For example, <em class="emphasis">cystic fibrosis</em>, the most common inherited disease in the United States, is caused by a defect in the transport system (in this case, chloride ions). Similarly, in many cases, <em class="emphasis">hypertension</em>, or high blood pressure, is thought to be due to defective Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup> uptake and/or excretion. If too much Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup> is absorbed from the diet (or if too little is excreted), water diffuses from tissues into the blood to dilute the solution, thereby decreasing the osmotic pressure in the circulatory system. The increased volume increases the blood pressure, and ruptured arteries called <em class="emphasis">aneurysms</em> can result, often in the brain. Because high blood pressure causes other medical problems as well, it is one of the most important biomedical disorders in modern society.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s02_s01_p03">For patients who suffer from hypertension, low-sodium diets that use NaCl substitutes, such as KCl, are often prescribed. Although KCl and NaCl give similar flavors to foods, the K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> is not readily taken up by the highly specific Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup>-uptake system. This approach to controlling hypertension is controversial, however, because direct correlations between dietary Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup> content and blood pressure are difficult to demonstrate in the general population. More important, recent observations indicate that high blood pressure may correlate more closely with inadequate intake of calcium in the diet than with excessive sodium levels. This finding is important because the typical “low-sodium” diet is also low in good sources of calcium, such as dairy products.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s02_s01_p04">Some of the most important biological functions of the group 1 and group 2 metals are due to small changes in the cellular concentrations of the metal ion. The transmission of nerve impulses, for example, is accompanied by an increased flux of Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ions into a nerve cell. Similarly, the binding of various hormones to specific receptors on the surface of a cell leads to a rapid influx of Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ions; the resulting sudden rise in the intracellular Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> concentration triggers other events, such as muscle contraction, the release of neurotransmitters, enzyme activation, or the secretion of other hormones.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s02_s01_p05">Within cells, K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> and Mg<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> often activate particular enzymes by binding to specific, negatively charged sites in the enzyme structure. <em class="emphasis">Chlorophyll</em>, the green pigment used by all plants to absorb light and drive the process of <em class="emphasis">photosynthesis</em>, contains magnesium. During photosynthesis, CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> is reduced to form sugars such as glucose.

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s02_s02_p01">Because the health of cells depends on maintaining the proper levels of cations in intracellular fluids, any change that affects the normal flux of metal ions across cell membranes could well cause an organism to die. Molecules that facilitate the transport of metal ions across membranes are generally called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ionophores</a><span class="glossdef">A molecule that facilitates the transport of metal ions across membranes.</span></span> (<em class="emphasis">ion</em> plus <em class="emphasis">phore</em> from the Greek <em class="emphasis">phorein</em>, meaning “to carry”). Many ionophores are potent antibiotics that can kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. An example is <em class="emphasis">valinomycin</em>, a cyclic molecule with a central cavity lined with oxygen atoms (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s02_s02_f01">Figure 21.14 "Valinomycin Is an Antibiotic That Functions Like an Ionophore"</a>) that is similar to the cavity of a crown ether (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch13_s02#averill_1.0-ch13_s02_s04_f02">Figure 13.7 "Crown Ethers and Cryptands"</a>). Like a crown ether, valinomycin is highly selective: its affinity for K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> is about 1000 times greater than that for Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup>. By increasing the flux of K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ions into cells, valinomycin disrupts the normal K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> gradient across a cell membrane, thereby killing the cell (part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch21_s05_s02_s02_f01">Figure 21.14 "Valinomycin Is an Antibiotic That Functions Like an Ionophore"</a>).</p>

                <p class="para">(a) This model of the structure of the K<sup class="superscript">+</sup>–valinomycin complex, determined by x-ray diffraction, shows how the valinomycin molecule wraps itself around the K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ion, shielding it from the environment, in a manner reminiscent of a crown ether complex. (For more information on the crown ethers, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch13#averill_1.0-ch13">Chapter 13 "Solutions"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch13_s02#averill_1.0-ch13_s02">Section 13.2 "Solubility and Molecular Structure"</a>.) (b) Valinomycin kills bacteria by facilitating the transport of K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ions across the cell membrane, thereby disrupting the normal distribution of ions in the bacterium. At the surface of the membrane, valinomycin binds a K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ion. Because the hydrophobic exterior of the valinomycin molecule forms a “doughnut” that shields the positive charge of the metal ion, the K<sup class="superscript">+</sup>–valinomycin complex is highly soluble in the nonpolar interior of the membrane. After the K<sup class="superscript">+</sup>–valinomycin complex diffuses across the membrane to the interior of the cell, the K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ion is released, and the valinomycin is free to diffuse back to the other side of the membrane to bind another K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ion. Valinomycin thereby destroys the normal K<sup class="superscript">+</sup> gradient across the membrane, killing the cell.</p>
