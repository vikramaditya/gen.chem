        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p01">As the pressure on a gas increases, the volume of the gas decreases because the gas particles are forced closer together. Conversely, as the pressure on a gas decreases, the gas volume increases because the gas particles can now move farther apart. Weather balloons get larger as they rise through the atmosphere to regions of lower pressure because the volume of the gas has increased; that is, the atmospheric gas exerts less pressure on the surface of the balloon, so the interior gas expands until the internal and external pressures are equal.</p>

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p02">Boyle, the youngest (and 14th!) child of the Earl of Cork, was an important early figure in chemistry whose views were often at odds with accepted wisdom. Boyle’s studies of gases are reported to have utilized a very tall J-tube that he set up in the entryway of his house, which was several stories tall. He is known for the gas law that bears his name and for his book, <em class="emphasis">The Sceptical Chymist</em>, which was published in 1661 and influenced chemists for many years after his death. In addition, one of Boyle’s early essays on morals is said to have inspired Jonathan Swift to write <em class="emphasis">Gulliver’s Travels</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p03">The Irish chemist Robert Boyle (1627–1691) carried out some of the earliest experiments that determined the quantitative relationship between the pressure and the volume of a gas. Boyle used a J-shaped tube partially filled with mercury, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_f01">Figure 10.6 "Boyle’s Experiment Using a J-Shaped Tube to Determine the Relationship between Gas Pressure and Volume"</a>. In these experiments, a small amount of a gas or air is trapped above the mercury column, and its volume is measured at atmospheric pressure and constant temperature. More mercury is then poured into the open arm to increase the pressure on the gas sample. The pressure on the gas is atmospheric pressure <em class="emphasis">plus</em> the difference in the heights of the mercury columns, and the resulting volume is measured. This process is repeated until either there is no more room in the open arm or the volume of the gas is too small to be measured accurately. Data such as those from one of Boyle’s own experiments may be plotted in several ways (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_f02">Figure 10.7 "Plots of Boyle’s Data"</a>). A simple plot of <em class="emphasis">V</em> versus <em class="emphasis">P</em> gives a curve called a <em class="emphasis">hyperbola</em> and reveals an <em class="emphasis">inverse</em> relationship between pressure and volume: as the pressure is doubled, the volume decreases by a factor of two. This relationship between the two quantities is described as follows:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p01">Hot air rises, which is why hot-air balloons ascend through the atmosphere and why warm air collects near the ceiling and cooler air collects at ground level. Because of this behavior, heating registers are placed on or near the floor, and vents for air-conditioning are placed on or near the ceiling. The fundamental reason for this behavior is that gases expand when they are heated. Because the same amount of substance now occupies a greater volume, hot air is less dense than cold air. The substance with the lower density—in this case hot air—rises through the substance with the higher density, the cooler air.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p02">The first experiments to quantify the relationship between the temperature and the volume of a gas were carried out in 1783 by an avid balloonist, the French chemist Jacques Alexandre César Charles (1746–1823). Charles’s initial experiments showed that a plot of the volume of a given sample of gas versus temperature (in degrees Celsius) at constant pressure is a straight line. Similar but more precise studies were carried out by another balloon enthusiast, the Frenchman Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac (1778–1850), who showed that a plot of <em class="emphasis">V</em> versus <em class="emphasis">T</em> was a straight line that could be extrapolated to a point at zero volume, a theoretical condition now known to correspond to −273.15°C (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_f01">Figure 10.8 "The Relationship between Volume and Temperature"</a>).<span class="footnote" id="averill_1.0-fn10_002">A sample of gas cannot <em class="emphasis">really</em> have a volume of zero because any sample of matter must have <em class="emphasis">some</em> volume.

When the balloon descended in a nearby village, however, the terrified townspeople destroyed it. In 1804, Gay-Lussac managed to ascend to 23,000 ft (more than 7000 m) to collect samples of the atmosphere to analyze its composition as a function of altitude. In the process, he had trouble breathing and nearly froze to death, but he set an altitude record that endured for decades.
