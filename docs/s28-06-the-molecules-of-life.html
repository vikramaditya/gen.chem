A detailed understanding of the reactions that occur in living organisms is the goal of biochemistry, which deals with a wide variety of organic structures and reactions. The most abundant substances found in living systems belong to four major classes: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids. Here we briefly describe the structure and some functions of these biological molecules.</p>

In the simplest amino acid, glycine, the R group is hydrogen (–H), but in other naturally occurring amino acids, the R group may be an alkyl group or a substituted alkyl group, a carboxylic group, or an aryl group. The nature of the R group determines the particular chemical properties of each amino acid. In <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05_s04#averill_1.0-ch05_s04_f01">Figure 5.16 "The Structures of 10 Amino Acids"</a>, all the amino acids found in proteins except glycine are chiral compounds, which suggests that their interactions with other chiral compounds are selective. Some proteins, called enzymes, catalyze biological reactions, whereas many others have structural, contractile, or signaling functions. Because we have described proteins previously, we will not discuss them further.</p>

The simplest carbohydrates consist of unbranched chains of three to eight carbon atoms: one carbon atom is part of a carbonyl group, and some or all of the others are bonded to hydroxyl groups. The structure of a carbohydrate can be drawn either as a hydrocarbon chain, using a <em class="emphasis">Fischer projection</em>, or as a ring, using a <em class="emphasis">Haworth projection</em> (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s06_s02_f01">Figure 24.21 "Fischer Projection and Haworth Projection of Glucose"</a>). The Haworth projection is named after the British chemist Sir Walter Norman Haworth, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937 for his discovery that sugars exist mainly in their cyclic forms, as well as for his collaboration on the synthesis of vitamin C. The cyclic form is the product of nucleophilic attack by the oxygen of a hydroxyl group on the electrophilic carbon of the carbonyl group within the same molecule, producing a stable ring structure composed of five or six carbons that minimizes bond strain (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s06_s02_f01">Figure 24.21 "Fischer Projection and Haworth Projection of Glucose"</a>). The substituents on the right side of the carbon chain in a Fischer projection are in the “down” position in the corresponding Haworth projection. Attack by the hydroxyl group on either side of the carbonyl group leads to the formation of two cyclic forms, called <em class="emphasis">anomers</em>: an α form, with the –OH in the “down” position, and a β form, with the –OH in the “up” position.</p>

The hydroxyl groups can undergo substitution reactions, resulting in derivatives of the original compound. One such derivative is Sucralose, an artificial sweetener that is six times sweeter than sucrose; it is made by replacing two of the hydroxyl groups on sucrose with chlorine. Carbohydrates can also eliminate hydroxyl groups, producing alkenes.</p>

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s06_s04_p07"><strong class="emphasis bold">Proteins</strong> are biologically active polymers formed from amino acids linked together by amide bonds. All the amino acids in proteins are chiral compounds except glycine. The most common organic compounds found in nature are the <strong class="emphasis bold">carbohydrates</strong>, polyhydroxy aldehydes or polyhydroxy ketones in unbranched chains of three to eight carbons. They are classified according to the number of sugar, or saccharide, units, and they can be drawn as a chain in a Fischer projection or in a cyclic form called a Haworth projection. The two cyclic forms in a Haworth projection are called anomers. Many sugars contain at least one chiral center. With their carbonyl and hydroxyl functional groups, carbohydrates can undergo a variety of biochemically relevant reactions. Starch and cellulose differ only in the connectivity between glucose units. Starches can be branched or unbranched, but cellulose, the structural material of plants, is unbranched, and cannot be digested by humans. <strong class="emphasis bold">Lipids</strong> are insoluble in water. The simplest lipids, fatty acids, have a long hydrocarbon chain ending in a carboxylic acid functional group. Their physical properties depend on the number of double bonds in the chain. Prostaglandins, hormone-like substances, are formed from unsaturated fatty acids, and waxes are long-chain esters of saturated fatty acids. Triacylglycerols, which the body uses to store fats and oils, consist of glycerol esterified to three fatty acid molecules. Steroids, which include cholesterol and the steroid hormones, are characterized by three cyclohexane rings and one cyclopentane ring fused together. The basic structural units of DNA and RNA are the <strong class="emphasis bold">nucleic acids</strong>, whose structures are derived from nitrogen-containing cyclic compounds called pyrimidines and purines. These structures are linked to a sugar through a glycosidic bond, forming a nucleoside. Adding a phosphoric acid group produces a nucleotide. Nucleotides link to form a polymeric chain that is the backbone of DNA and RNA.</p>
