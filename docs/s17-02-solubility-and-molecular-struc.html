    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s02_p01">When a solute dissolves, its individual atoms, molecules, or ions interact with the solvent, become solvated, and are able to diffuse independently throughout the solution (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch13_s02_f01">Figure 13.4 "Dissolution and Precipitation"</a>). This is not, however, a unidirectional process. If the molecule or ion happens to collide with the surface of a particle of the undissolved solute, it may adhere to the particle in a process called <em class="emphasis">crystallization</em>. Dissolution and crystallization continue as long as excess solid is present, resulting in a <em class="emphasis">dynamic equilibrium</em> analogous to the equilibrium that maintains the vapor pressure of a liquid.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p01">The maximum amount of a solute that can dissolve in a solvent at a specified temperature and pressure is its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">solubility</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of the how much of a solid substance remains dissolved in a given amount of a specified liquid at a specified temperature and pressure.</span></span>. Solubility is often expressed as the mass of solute per volume (g/L) or mass of solute per mass of solvent (g/g), or as the moles of solute per volume (mol/L). Even for very soluble substances, however, there is usually a limit to how much solute can dissolve in a given quantity of solvent. In general, the solubility of a substance depends on not only the energetic factors we have discussed but also the temperature and, for gases, the pressure. At 20°C, for example, 177 g of NaI, 91.2 g of NaBr, 35.9 g of NaCl, and only 4.1 g of NaF dissolve in 100 g of water. At 70°C, however, the solubilities increase to 295 g of NaI, 119 g of NaBr, 37.5 g of NaCl, and 4.8 g of NaF. As you learned in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12#averill_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Solids"</a>, the lattice energies of the sodium halides increase from NaI to NaF. The fact that the solubilities decrease as the lattice energy increases suggests that the Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> term in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch13_s01#averill_1.0-ch13_s01_s02_f01">Figure 13.1 "Enthalpy Changes That Accompany the Formation of a Solution"</a> dominates for this series of compounds.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p02">A solution with the maximum possible amount of solute is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">saturated</a><span class="glossdef">A solution with the maximum possible amount of a solute under a given set of conditions.</span></span>. If a solution contains less than the maximum amount of solute, it is <em class="emphasis">unsaturated</em>. When a solution is saturated and excess solute is present, the rate of dissolution is exactly equal to the rate of crystallization (part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch13_s02_f01">Figure 13.4 "Dissolution and Precipitation"</a>). Using the value just stated, a saturated aqueous solution of NaCl, for example, contains 35.9 g of NaCl per 100 mL of water at 20°C. We can prepare a homogeneous saturated solution by adding excess solute (in this case, greater than 35.9 g of NaCl) to the solvent (water), stirring until the maximum possible amount of solute has dissolved, and then removing undissolved solute by filtration.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p04">Because the solubility of most solids increases with increasing temperature, a saturated solution that was prepared at a higher temperature usually contains more dissolved solute than it would contain at a lower temperature.

Like a supercooled or superheated liquid (see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch11#averill_1.0-ch11">Chapter 11 "Liquids"</a>), a supersaturated solution is unstable. Consequently, adding a small particle of the solute, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">seed crystal</a><span class="glossdef">A solid sample of a substance that can be added to a supercooled liquid or a supersaturated solution to help induce crystallization.</span></span>, will usually cause the excess solute to rapidly precipitate or crystallize, sometimes with spectacular results, as was shown in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01_s03#averill_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_f03">Figure 1.9 "The Crystallization of Sodium Acetate from a Concentrated Solution of Sodium Acetate in Water"</a>. The rate of crystallization in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch13_s02_eq01" xrefstyle="select:label">Equation 13.4</a> is greater than the rate of dissolution, so crystals or a precipitate form (part (d) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch13_s02_f01">Figure 13.4 "Dissolution and Precipitation"</a>). In contrast, adding a seed crystal to a saturated solution reestablishes the dynamic equilibrium, and the <em class="emphasis">net</em> quantity of dissolved solute no longer changes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s02_s01_p05">Because crystallization is the reverse of dissolution, a substance that requires an input of heat to form a solution (Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">soln</sub> &gt; 0) releases that heat when it crystallizes from solution (Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">crys</sub> &lt; 0). The amount of heat released is proportional to the amount of solute that exceeds its solubility. Two substances that have a positive enthalpy of solution are sodium thiosulfate (Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>S<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">3</sub>) and sodium acetate (CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Na), both of which are used in commercial hot packs, small bags of supersaturated solutions used to warm hands (see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05_s03#averill_1.0-ch05_s03_s01_f01">Figure 5.13 "The High Specific Heat of Liquid Water Has Major Effects on Climate"</a>).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_p01">The interactions that determine the solubility of a substance in a liquid depend largely on the chemical nature of the solute (such as whether it is ionic or molecular) rather than on its physical state (solid, liquid, or gas).

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_p01">The London dispersion forces, dipole–dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonds that hold molecules to other molecules are generally weak. Even so, energy is required to disrupt these interactions. As we described in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch13_s01#averill_1.0-ch13_s01">Section 13.1 "Factors Affecting Solution Formation"</a>, unless some of that energy is recovered in the formation of new, favorable solute–solvent interactions, the increase in entropy on solution formation is not enough for a solution to form.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_p02">For solutions of gases in liquids, we can safely ignore the energy required to separate the solute molecules (Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> = 0) because the molecules are already separated. Thus we need to consider only the energy required to separate the solvent molecules (Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>) and the energy released by new solute–solvent interactions (Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">3</sub>). Nonpolar gases such as N<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, O<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, and Ar have no dipole moment and cannot engage in dipole–dipole interactions or hydrogen bonding. Consequently, the only way they can interact with a solvent is by means of London dispersion forces, which may be weaker than the solvent–solvent interactions in a polar solvent. It is not surprising, then, that nonpolar gases are most soluble in nonpolar solvents. In this case, Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> and Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">3</sub> are both small and of similar magnitude. In contrast, for a solution of a nonpolar gas in a polar solvent, Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> is far greater than Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">3</sub>. As a result, nonpolar gases are less soluble in polar solvents than in nonpolar solvents. For example, the concentration of N<sub class="subscript">2</sub> in a saturated solution of N<sub class="subscript">2</sub> in water, a polar solvent, is only 7.07 × 10<sup class="superscript">−4</sup> M compared with 4.5 × 10<sup class="superscript">−3</sup> M for a saturated solution of N<sub class="subscript">2</sub> in benzene, a nonpolar solvent.</p>

The strengths of the intermolecular attractions are comparable; thus the enthalpy of solution is expected to be small (Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">soln</sub> ≈ 0), and the increase in entropy drives the formation of a solution. If the predominant intermolecular interactions in two liquids are very different from one another, however, they may be immiscible. For example, organic liquids such as benzene, hexane, CCl<sub class="subscript">4</sub>, and CS<sub class="subscript">2</sub> (S=C=S) are nonpolar and have no ability to act as hydrogen bond donors or acceptors with hydrogen-bonding solvents such as H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O, HF, and NH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>; hence they are immiscible in these solvents. When shaken with water, they form separate phases or layers separated by an <em class="emphasis">interface</em> (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s01_f01">Figure 13.5 "Immiscible Liquids"</a>), the region between the two layers.

For example, elemental sulfur is a solid consisting of cyclic S<sub class="subscript">8</sub> molecules that have no dipole moment. Because the S<sub class="subscript">8</sub> rings in solid sulfur are held to other rings by London dispersion forces, elemental sulfur is insoluble in water. It is, however, soluble in nonpolar solvents that have comparable London dispersion forces, such as CS<sub class="subscript">2</sub> (23 g/100 mL). In contrast, glucose contains five –OH groups that can form hydrogen bonds. Consequently, glucose is very soluble in water (91 g/120 mL of water) but essentially insoluble in nonpolar solvents such as benzene. The structure of one isomer of glucose is shown here.</p>

Hydrophobic substances do not interact favorably with water.</span></span> (“water fearing”), meaning that it repels water. A hydrophilic substance is polar and often contains O–H or N–H groups that can form hydrogen bonds to water. For example, glucose with its five O–H groups is hydrophilic. In contrast, a hydrophobic substance may be polar but usually contains C–H bonds that do not interact favorably with water, as is the case with naphthalene and <em class="emphasis">n</em>-octane. Hydrophilic substances tend to be very soluble in water and other strongly polar solvents, whereas hydrophobic substances are essentially insoluble in water and soluble in nonpolar solvents such as benzene and cyclohexane.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p02">The difference between hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances has substantial consequences in biological systems. For example, vitamins can be classified as either <em class="emphasis">fat soluble</em> or <em class="emphasis">water soluble</em>. Fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A, are mostly nonpolar, hydrophobic molecules. As a result, they tend to be absorbed into fatty tissues and stored there. In contrast, water-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin C, are polar, hydrophilic molecules that circulate in the blood and intracellular fluids, which are primarily aqueous. Water-soluble vitamins are therefore excreted much more rapidly from the body and must be replenished in our daily diet. A comparison of the chemical structures of vitamin A and vitamin C quickly reveals why one is hydrophobic and the other hydrophilic.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p03">Because water-soluble vitamins are rapidly excreted, the risk of consuming them in excess is relatively small. Eating a dozen oranges a day is likely to make you tired of oranges long before you suffer any ill effects due to their high vitamin C content. In contrast, fat-soluble vitamins constitute a significant health hazard when consumed in large amounts. For example, the livers of polar bears and other large animals that live in cold climates contain large amounts of vitamin A, which have occasionally proven fatal to humans who have eaten them.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_p01">Solutions are not limited to gases and liquids; solid solutions also exist. For example, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">amalgams</a><span class="glossdef">A solution (usually a solid solution) of a metal in liquid mercury.</span></span>, which are usually solids, are solutions of metals in liquid mercury. Because most metals are soluble in mercury, amalgams are used in gold mining, dentistry, and many other applications. A major difficulty when mining gold is separating very small particles of pure gold from tons of crushed rock. One way to accomplish this is to agitate a suspension of the crushed rock with liquid mercury, which dissolves the gold (as well as any metallic silver that might be present). The very dense liquid gold–mercury amalgam is then isolated and the mercury distilled away.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_p02">An alloy is a solid or liquid solution that consists of one or more elements in a metallic matrix. A solid alloy has a single homogeneous phase in which the crystal structure of the solvent remains unchanged by the presence of the solute. Thus the microstructure of the alloy is uniform throughout the sample. Examples are substitutional and interstitial alloys such as brass or solder. (For more information about alloys, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12#averill_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Solids"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12_s05#averill_1.0-ch12_s05">Section 12.5 "Correlation between Bonding and the Properties of Solids"</a>) Liquid alloys include sodium/potassium and gold/mercury. In contrast, a <em class="emphasis">partial</em> alloy solution has two or more phases that can be homogeneous in the distribution of the components, but the microstructures of the two phases are <em class="emphasis">not</em> the same. As a liquid solution of lead and tin is cooled, for example, different crystalline phases form at different cooling temperatures. As you learned in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12#averill_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Solids"</a>, alloys usually have properties that differ from those of the component elements.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s02_s03_p03">Network solids such as diamond, graphite, and SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> are insoluble in all solvents with which they do not react chemically. The covalent bonds that hold the network or lattice together are simply too strong to be broken under normal conditions. They are certainly much stronger than any conceivable combination of intermolecular interactions that might occur in solution. Most metals are insoluble in virtually all solvents for the same reason: the delocalized metallic bonding is much stronger than any favorable metal atom–solvent interactions. Many metals react with solutions such as aqueous acids or bases to produce a solution. However, as we saw in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch13_s01#averill_1.0-ch13_s01">Section 13.1 "Factors Affecting Solution Formation"</a>, in these instances the metal undergoes a chemical transformation that cannot be reversed by simply removing the solvent.</p>

Ionic substances are generally most soluble in polar solvents; the higher the lattice energy, the more polar the solvent must be to overcome the lattice energy and dissolve the substance.

Many ionic compounds are soluble in other polar solvents, however, such as liquid ammonia, liquid hydrogen fluoride, and methanol.

Because the dipole moment of acetone (2.88 D), and thus its polarity, is actually larger than that of water (1.85 D), one might even expect that LiCl would be more soluble in acetone than in water. In fact, the opposite is true: 83 g of LiCl dissolve in 100 mL of water at 20°C, but only about 4.1 g of LiCl dissolve in 100 mL of acetone. This apparent contradiction arises from the fact that the dipole moment is a property of a single molecule in the gas phase. A more useful measure of the ability of a solvent to dissolve ionic compounds is its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dielectric constant (ε)</a><span class="glossdef">A constant that expresses the ability of a bulk substance to decrease the electrostatic forces between two charged particles.</span></span>, which is the ability of a bulk substance to decrease the electrostatic forces between two charged particles. By definition, the dielectric constant of a vacuum is 1. In essence, a solvent with a high dielectric constant causes the charged particles to behave as if they have been moved farther apart. At 25°C, the dielectric constant of water is 80.1, one of the highest known, and that of acetone is only 21.0. Hence water is better able to decrease the electrostatic attraction between Li<sup class="superscript">+</sup> and Cl<sup class="superscript">−</sup> ions, so LiCl is more soluble in water than in acetone. This behavior is in contrast to that of molecular substances, for which polarity is the dominant factor governing solubility.</p>
