        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch14_s08_s01_p01">In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">heterogeneous catalysis</a><span class="glossdef">A catalytic reaction in which the catalyst is in a different phase from the reactants.</span></span>, the catalyst is in a different phase from the reactants. At least one of the reactants interacts with the solid surface in a physical process called <em class="emphasis">adsorption</em> in such a way that a chemical bond in the reactant becomes weak and then breaks. <em class="emphasis">Poisons</em> are substances that bind irreversibly to catalysts, preventing reactants from adsorbing and thus reducing or destroying the catalyst’s efficiency.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch14_s08_s01_p02">An example of heterogeneous catalysis is the interaction of hydrogen gas with the surface of a metal, such as Ni, Pd, or Pt. As shown in part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch14_s08_s01_f01">Figure 14.27 "Hydrogenation of Ethylene on a Heterogeneous Catalyst"</a>, the hydrogen–hydrogen bonds break and produce individual adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the surface of the metal. Because the adsorbed atoms can move around on the surface, two hydrogen atoms can collide and form a molecule of hydrogen gas that can then leave the surface in the reverse process, called <em class="emphasis">desorption</em>. Adsorbed H atoms on a metal surface are substantially more reactive than a hydrogen molecule. Because the relatively strong H–H bond (dissociation energy = 432 kJ/mol) has already been broken, the energy barrier for most reactions of H<sub class="subscript">2</sub> is substantially lower on the catalyst surface.</p>

Hydrogenation is used in the food industry to convert vegetable oils, which consist of long chains of alkenes, to more commercially valuable solid derivatives that contain alkyl chains. Hydrogenation of some of the double bonds in polyunsaturated vegetable oils, for example, produces margarine, a product with a melting point, texture, and other physical properties similar to those of butter.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch14_s08_s01_p04">Several important examples of industrial heterogeneous catalytic reactions are in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch14_s08_s01_t01">Table 14.8 "Some Commercially Important Reactions that Employ Heterogeneous Catalysts"</a>. Although the mechanisms of these reactions are considerably more complex than the simple hydrogenation reaction described here, they all involve adsorption of the reactants onto a solid catalytic surface, chemical reaction of the adsorbed species (sometimes via a number of intermediate species), and finally desorption of the products from the surface.</p>

The number of collisions between reactants and catalyst is at a maximum because the catalyst is uniformly dispersed throughout the reaction mixture. Many homogeneous catalysts in industry are transition metal compounds (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch14_s08_s02_t01">Table 14.9 "Some Commercially Important Reactions that Employ Homogeneous Catalysts"</a>), but recovering these expensive catalysts from solution has been a major challenge. As an added barrier to their widespread commercial use, many homogeneous catalysts can be used only at relatively low temperatures, and even then they tend to decompose slowly in solution. Despite these problems, a number of commercially viable processes have been developed in recent years. High-density polyethylene and polypropylene are produced by homogeneous catalysis.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch14_s08_s03_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Enzymes</strong>, catalysts that occur naturally in living organisms, are almost all protein molecules with typical molecular masses of 20,000–100,000 amu. Some are homogeneous catalysts that react in aqueous solution within a cellular compartment of an organism. Others are heterogeneous catalysts embedded within the membranes that separate cells and cellular compartments from their surroundings. The reactant in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">substrate</a><span class="glossdef">The reactant in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch14_s08_s03_p02">Because enzymes can increase reaction rates by enormous factors (up to 10<sup class="superscript">17</sup> times the uncatalyzed rate) and tend to be very specific, typically producing only a single product in quantitative yield, they are the focus of active research. At the same time, enzymes are usually expensive to obtain, they often cease functioning at temperatures greater than 37°C, have limited stability in solution, and have such high specificity that they are confined to turning one particular set of reactants into one particular product. This means that separate processes using different enzymes must be developed for chemically similar reactions, which is time-consuming and expensive. Thus far, enzymes have found only limited industrial applications, although they are used as ingredients in laundry detergents, contact lens cleaners, and meat tenderizers. The enzymes in these applications tend to be <em class="emphasis">proteases</em>, which are able to cleave the amide bonds that hold amino acids together in proteins. Meat tenderizers, for example, contain a protease called papain, which is isolated from papaya juice. It cleaves some of the long, fibrous protein molecules that make inexpensive cuts of beef tough, producing a piece of meat that is more tender. Some insects, like the bombadier beetle, carry an enzyme capable of catalyzing the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch14_s08_s03_f01">Figure 14.28 "A Catalytic Defense Mechanism"</a>).</p>

Irreversible inhibitors are therefore the equivalent of poisons in heterogeneous catalysis. One of the oldest and most widely used commercial enzyme inhibitors is aspirin, which selectively inhibits one of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of molecules that trigger inflammation. The design and synthesis of related molecules that are more effective, more selective, and less toxic than aspirin are important objectives of biomedical research.</p>

                        <p class="para">The kinetics of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction can be analyzed by plotting the reaction rate versus the substrate concentration. This type of analysis is referred to as a Michaelis–Menten treatment. At low substrate concentrations, the plot shows behavior characteristic of first-order kinetics, but at very high substrate concentrations, the behavior shows zeroth-order kinetics. Explain this phenomenon.</p>
