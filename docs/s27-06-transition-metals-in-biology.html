In this section, we describe several systems that illustrate the roles transition metals play in biological systems. Our goal is for you to understand why the chemical properties of these elements make them essential for life. We begin with a discussion of the strategies organisms use to extract transition metals from their environment. The section continues with a brief discussion of the use of transition metals in reactions that involve the transfer of electrons, reactions of small molecules such as O<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, Lewis-acid catalysis, and the generation of reactive organic radicals.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Uptake and Storage of Transition Metals</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s01_p01">In <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01#averill_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Chemistry"</a>, we described the three possible dietary levels for any essential element: deficient, optimal, and toxic, in order of increasing concentration in the diet (<a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01_s08#averill_1.0-ch01_s08_s02_f01">Figure 1.27 "Possible Concentrations of an Essential Element in the Diet"</a>). If the concentration of an essential element in the diet is too low, an organism must be able to extract the element from the environment and concentrate it. If the concentration of an essential element in the diet is too high, an organism must be able to limit its intake to avoid toxic effects. Moreover, organisms must be able to switch off the uptake process rapidly if dietary levels rise suddenly, and they must be able to store essential elements for future use.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s01_p02">Three distinct steps are involved in transition metal uptake. First, the metal must be “mobilized” from the environment and brought into contact with a cell in a form that can be absorbed. Second, the metal must be transported across the cell membrane into the cell. Third, the element must be transported to its point of utilization within a cell or to other cells within the organism. In our discussion, we focus on the uptake, transport, and storage of iron, which illustrates the most important points. Because iron deficiency (anemia) is the most widespread nutritional deficiency known in humans, the uptake of iron is especially well understood.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s01_p03">In <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch17#averill_1.0-ch17">Chapter 17 "Solubility and Complexation Equilibriums"</a>, you learned that the solubility of metal ions such as Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup>, which form highly insoluble hydroxides, depends on the pH and the presence of complexing agents. In an oxygen-containing atmosphere, iron exists as Fe(III) because of the positive reduction potential of Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> (Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> + e<sup class="superscript">−</sup> → Fe<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>; <em class="emphasis">E</em>° = +0.77 V). Because ferric hydroxide [Fe(OH)<sub class="subscript">3</sub>] is highly insoluble (<em class="emphasis">K</em><sub class="subscript">sp</sub> ≈ 1 × 10<sup class="superscript">−39</sup>), the equilibrium concentration of Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup>(aq) at pH 7.0 is very low, about 10<sup class="superscript">−18</sup> M. You would have to drink 2 × 10<sup class="superscript">13</sup> L of iron-saturated water per day (roughly 5 mi<sup class="superscript">3</sup>) to consume the recommended daily intake of Fe for humans, which is about 1 mg/day. Animals such as humans can overcome this problem by consuming concentrated sources of iron, such as red meat, but microorganisms cannot.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s01_p04">Consequently, most microorganisms synthesize and secrete organic molecules called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">siderophores</a><span class="glossdef">An organic ligand that has a high affinity for Fe(III) and is secreted into the surrounding medium to increase the total concentration of dissolved iron.</span></span> to increase the total concentration of available iron in the surrounding medium. Siderophores are generally cyclic compounds that use bidentate ligands, such as the <em class="emphasis">hydroxamate</em> and <em class="emphasis">catecholate</em> groups shown here, to bind Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> in an octahedral arrangement. Typical siderophores are <em class="emphasis">ferrichrome</em>, a cyclic peptide produced by fungi, and <em class="emphasis">enterobactin</em>, a cyclic ester produced by bacteria (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s01_f01">Figure 23.18 "Siderophores"</a>). Attaching the three iron ligands to a cyclic framework greatly increases the stability of the resulting Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> complex due to the chelate effect described in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch23_s04#averill_1.0-ch23_s04">Section 23.4 "Coordination Compounds"</a>. The formation constants for the Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> complexes of ferrichrome and enterobactin are about 10<sup class="superscript">32</sup> and 10<sup class="superscript">40</sup>, respectively, which are high enough to allow them to dissolve almost any Fe(III) compound.</p>

            <p class="para">Ferrichrome (a) and enterobactin (b) are siderophores that use hydroxamate and catecholate ligands, respectively, to bind Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup>. The “wrapped” drawing of enterobactin (c) shows how the cyclic ester framework places the three catecholate ligands in the correct orientation to bind to a single Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> ion, which is an application of the chelate effect. The actual structure of ferrichrome is similar to that of enterobactin, with the three hydroxamate ligands adjacent to one another for optimal binding of Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup>. Note: For clarity, most or all hydrogen atoms have been omitted in this and the following structures.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s01_p05">Siderophores increase the [Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup>] in solution, providing the bacterium that synthesized them (as well as any competitors) with a supply of iron. In addition, siderophores neutralize the positive charge on the metal ion and provide a hydrophobic “wrapping” that enables the Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup>–siderophore complex to be recognized by a specific protein that transports it into the interior of a cell. Once it is inside a cell, the iron is reduced to Fe<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>, which has a much lower affinity for the siderophore and spontaneously dissociates.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s01_p06">In contrast, multicellular organisms can increase the concentration of iron in their diet by lowering the pH in the gastrointestinal tract. At pH 1.0 (the approximate pH of the stomach), most Fe(III) salts dissolve to form Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup>(aq), which is absorbed by specific proteins in the intestinal wall. A protein called <em class="emphasis">transferrin</em> forms a complex with iron(III), allowing it to be transported to other cells. Proteins that bind tightly to Fe(III) can also be used as antibacterial agents because iron is absolutely essential for bacterial growth. For example, milk, tears, and egg white all contain proteins similar to transferrin, and their high affinity for Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> allows them to sequester iron, thereby preventing bacteria from growing in these nutrient-rich media.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s01_p07">Iron is released from transferrin by reduction to Fe<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>, and then it is either used immediately (e.g., for the synthesis of hemoglobin) or stored in a very large protein called <em class="emphasis">ferritin</em> for future use (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s01_f02">Figure 23.19 "Ferritin, an Iron Storage Protein"</a>). Ferritin uses oxygen to oxidize Fe<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> to Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup>, which at neutral pH precipitates in the central cavity of the protein as a polymeric mixture of Fe(OH)<sub class="subscript">3</sub> and FePO<sub class="subscript">4</sub>. Because a fully loaded ferritin molecule can contain as many as 4500 Fe atoms, which corresponds to about 25% Fe by mass, ferritin is an effective way to store iron in a highly concentrated form. When iron is needed by a cell, the Fe<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> is reduced to the much more soluble Fe<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> by a reductant such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The structure of ferritin contains channels at the junctions of the subunits, which provide pathways for iron to enter and leave the interior of a molecule.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s03_s01_p01">Blue copper proteins were first isolated from bacteria in the 1950s and from plant tissues in the early 1960s. The intense blue color of these proteins is due to a strong absorption band at a wavelength of about 600 nm. Although simple Cu<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> complexes, such as [Cu(H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O)<sub class="subscript">6</sub>]<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> and [Cu(NH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>)<sub class="subscript">4</sub>]<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>, are also blue due to an absorption band at 600 nm, the intensity of the absorption band is about 100 times less than that of a blue copper protein. Moreover, the reduction potential for the Cu<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>/Cu<sup class="superscript">+</sup> couple in a blue copper protein is usually +0.3 to +0.5 V, considerably more positive than that of the aqueous Cu<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>/Cu<sup class="superscript">+</sup> couple (+0.15 V).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s03_s01_p02">The copper center in blue copper proteins has a distorted tetrahedral structure, in which the copper is bound to four amino acid side chains (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s03_s01_f01">Figure 23.20 "A Blue Copper Protein"</a>). Although the most common structures for four-coordinate Cu<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> and Cu<sup class="superscript">+</sup> complexes are square planar and tetrahedral, respectively, the structures of the oxidized (Cu<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>) and reduced (Cu<sup class="superscript">+</sup>) forms of the protein are essentially identical. Thus the protein forces the Cu<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ion to adopt a higher-energy structure that is more suitable for Cu<sup class="superscript">+</sup>, which makes the Cu<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> form easier to reduce and raises its reduction potential.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s03_s01_p03">Moreover, by forcing the oxidized and reduced forms of the metal complex to have essentially the same structure, the protein ensures that electron transfer to and from the copper site is rapid because only minimal structural reorganization of the metal center is required. Kinetics studies on simple metal complexes have shown that electron-transfer reactions tend to be slow when the structures of the oxidized and reduced forms of a metal complex are very different, and fast when they are similar. You will see that other metal centers used for biological electron-transfer reactions are also set up for minimal structural reorganization after electron transfer, which ensures the rapid transfer of electrons.</p>

At 25°C, however, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water in contact with air is only about 0.25 mM. Because of their high surface area-to-volume ratio, aerobic microorganisms can obtain enough oxygen for respiration by passive diffusion of O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> through the cell membrane. As the size of an organism increases, however, its volume increases much more rapidly than its surface area, and the need for oxygen depends on its volume. Consequently, as a multicellular organism grows larger, its need for O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> rapidly outstrips the supply available through diffusion. Unless a transport system is available to provide an adequate supply of oxygen for the interior cells, organisms that contain more than a few cells cannot exist. In addition, O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> is such a powerful oxidant that the oxidation reactions used to obtain metabolic energy must be carefully controlled to avoid releasing so much heat that the water in the cell boils. Consequently, in higher-level organisms, the respiratory apparatus is located in internal compartments called <em class="emphasis">mitochondria</em>, which are the power plants of a cell.

The physiological consequences of the unusual S-shaped O<sub class="subscript">2</sub>-binding curve of hemoglobin are enormous.

Cooperativity in hemoglobin requires an interaction between the four heme groups in the hemoglobin tetramer, even though they are more than 3000 pm apart, and depends on the change in structure of the heme group that occurs with oxygen binding. The structures of deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin are slightly different, and as a result, deoxyhemoglobin has a much lower O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> affinity than myoglobin, whereas the O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> affinity of oxyhemoglobin is essentially identical to that of oxymyoglobin. Binding of the first two O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> molecules to deoxyhemoglobin causes the overall structure of the protein to change to that of oxyhemoglobin; consequently, the last two heme groups have a much higher affinity for O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> than the first two.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s04_s02_p08">Although CO has a much greater affinity for a ferrous heme than does O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> (by a factor of about 25,000), the affinity of CO for deoxyhemoglobin is only about 200 times greater than that of O<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, which suggests that something in the protein is decreasing its affinity for CO by a factor of about 100. Both CO and NO bind to ferrous hemes in a linear fashion, with an Fe–C(N)–O angle of about 180°, and the difference in the preferred geometry of O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> and CO provides a plausible explanation for the difference in affinities. As shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s04_s02_f04">Figure 23.26 "Binding of O"</a>, the imidazole group of the distal histidine is located precisely where the oxygen atom of bound CO would be if the Fe–C–O unit were linear. Consequently, CO cannot bind to the heme in a linear fashion; instead, it is forced to bind in a bent mode that is similar to the preferred structure for the Fe–O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> unit. This results in a significant decrease in the affinity of the heme for CO, while leaving the O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> affinity unchanged, which is important because carbon monoxide is produced continuously in the body by degradation of the porphyrin ligand (even in nonsmokers). Under normal conditions, CO occupies approximately 1% of the heme sites in hemoglobin and myoglobin. If the affinity of hemoglobin and myoglobin for CO were 100 times greater (due to the absence of the distal histidine), essentially 100% of the heme sites would be occupied by CO, and no oxygen could be transported to the tissues. Severe carbon-monoxide poisoning, which is frequently fatal, has exactly the same effect. Thus the primary function of the distal histidine appears to be to decrease the CO affinity of hemoglobin and myoglobin to avoid self-poisoning by CO.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s07_p01">An <em class="emphasis">organic radical</em> is an organic species that contains one or more unpaired electrons. Chemists often consider organic radicals to be highly reactive species that produce undesirable reactions. For example, they have been implicated in some of the irreversible chemical changes that accompany aging. It is surprising, however, that organic radicals are also essential components of many important enzymes, almost all of which use a metal ion to generate the organic radical within the enzyme. These enzymes are involved in the synthesis of hemoglobin and DNA, among other important biological molecules, and they are the targets of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of diseases such as anemia, sickle-cell anemia, and cancer. In this section, we discuss one class of radical enzymes that use vitamin B<sub class="subscript">12</sub>.</p>

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s07_p09">Three separate steps are required for organisms to obtain essential transition metals from their environment: mobilization of the metal, transport of the metal into the cell, and transfer of the metal to where it is needed within a cell or an organism. The process of iron uptake is best understood. To overcome the insolubility of Fe(OH)<sub class="subscript">3</sub>, many bacteria use organic ligands called <strong class="emphasis bold">siderophores</strong>, which have high affinity for Fe(III) and are secreted into the surrounding medium to increase the total concentration of dissolved iron. The iron–siderophore complex is absorbed by a cell, and the iron is released by reduction to Fe(II). Mammals use the low pH of the stomach to increase the concentration of dissolved iron. Iron is absorbed in the intestine, where it forms an Fe(III) complex with a protein called transferrin that is transferred to other cells for immediate use or storage in the form of ferritin.</p>
            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s06_s07_p10">Proteins that contain one or more tightly bound metal ions are called <strong class="emphasis bold">metalloproteins</strong>, and metalloproteins that catalyze biochemical reactions are called <strong class="emphasis bold">metalloenzymes</strong>. Proteins that transfer electrons from one place to another are called electron-transfer proteins. Most electron-transfer proteins are metalloproteins, such as iron–sulfur proteins, cytochromes, and blue copper proteins that accept and donate electrons. The oxidized and reduced centers in all electron-transfer proteins have similar structures to ensure that electron transfer to and from the metal occurs rapidly. Metalloproteins also use the ability of transition metals to bind small molecules, such as O<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, N<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, and H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, to transport or catalyze the reactions of these small molecules. For example, hemoglobin, hemerythrin, and hemocyanin, which contain heme iron, nonheme iron, and copper, respectively, are used by different kinds of organisms to bind and transfer O<sub class="subscript">2</sub>. Other metalloenzymes use transition-metal ions as Lewis acids to catalyze group transfer reactions. Finally, some metalloenzymes use homolytic cleavage of the cobalt–carbon bond in derivatives of vitamin B<sub class="subscript">12</sub> to generate an organic radical that can abstract a hydrogen atom and thus cause molecular rearrangements to occur.</p>
