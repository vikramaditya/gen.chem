Many of the molecular materials in consumer goods today, however, have very high molecular masses, ranging from thousands to millions of atomic mass units, and are formed from a carefully controlled series of reactions that produce giant molecules called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">polymers</a><span class="glossdef">A giant molecule that consists of many basic structural units (monomers) connected in a chain or network by covalent bonds.</span></span> (from the Greek <em class="emphasis">poly</em> and <em class="emphasis">meros</em>, meaning “many parts”).

They consist of basic structural units called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">monomers</a><span class="glossdef">The basic structural unit of a polymer.</span></span>, which are repeated many times in each molecule.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s01_p01">Polymers that occur naturally are crucial components of all organisms and form the fabric of our lives. Hair, silk, skin, feathers, muscle, and connective tissue are all primarily composed of proteins, the most familiar kind of naturally occurring, or biological, polymer. The monomers of many biological polymers are the amino acids introduced in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05#averill_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05_s04#averill_1.0-ch05_s04">Section 5.4 "Thermochemistry and Nutrition"</a>, each called an <em class="emphasis">amino acid residue</em>. The residues are linked together by amide bonds, also called peptide bonds, via a condensation reaction where H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O is eliminated:</p>

We write the structural formula of the product with the free amino group on the left (the <em class="emphasis">N-terminus</em>) and the free carboxylate group on the right (the <em class="emphasis">C-terminus</em>). For example, the structural formula for the product formed from the amino acids glycine and valine (glycyl-valine) is as follows:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s01_p03">The most important difference between synthetic and naturally occurring polymers is that the former usually contain very few different monomers, whereas biological polymers can have as many as 20 different kinds of amino acid residues arranged in many different orders. Chains with less than about 50 amino acid residues are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">peptides</a><span class="glossdef">Biological polymers with less than about 50 amino acid residues.</span></span>, whereas those with more than about 50 amino acid residues are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">proteins</a><span class="glossdef">Biological polymers with more than 50 amino acid residues linked together by amide bonds.</span></span>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s01_p05">Many small peptides have potent physiological activities. The <em class="emphasis">endorphins</em>, for example, are powerful, naturally occurring painkillers found in the brain. Other important peptides are the hormones vasopressin and oxytocin. Although their structures and amino acid sequences are similar, vasopressin is a blood pressure regulator, whereas oxytocin induces labor in pregnant women and milk production in nursing mothers. Oxytocin was the first biologically active peptide to be prepared in the laboratory by Vincent du Vigneaud (1901–1978), who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1955.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Synthetic Polymers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p01">Many of the synthetic polymers we use, such as plastics and rubbers, have commercial advantages over naturally occurring polymers because they can be produced inexpensively. Moreover, many synthetic polymers are actually more desirable than their natural counterparts because scientists can select monomer units to tailor the physical properties of the resulting polymer for particular purposes. For example, in many applications, wood has been replaced by plastics that are more durable, lighter, and easier to shape and maintain. Polymers are also increasingly used in engineering applications where weight reduction and corrosion resistance are required. Steel rods used to support concrete structures, for example, are often coated with a polymeric material when the structures are near ocean environments where steel is vulnerable to corrosion (For more information on corrosion, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch19#averill_1.0-ch19">Chapter 19 "Electrochemistry"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch19_s06#averill_1.0-ch19_s06">Section 19.6 "Corrosion"</a>.) In fact, the use of polymers in engineering applications is a very active area of research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p02">Probably the best-known example of a synthetic polymer is <em class="emphasis">nylon</em> (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_f01">Figure 12.32 "The Synthesis of Nylon"</a>). Its monomers are linked by amide bonds (which are called peptide bonds in biological polymers), so its physical properties are similar to those of some proteins because of their common structural unit—the amide group. Nylon is easily drawn into silky <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fibers</a><span class="glossdef">A particle of a synthetic polymer that is more than 100 times longer than it is wide.</span></span> that are more than a hundred times longer than they are wide and can be woven into fabrics. Nylon fibers are so light and strong that during World War II, all available nylon was commandeered for use in parachutes, ropes, and other military items. With polymer chains that are fully extended and run parallel to the fiber axis, nylon fibers resist stretching, just like naturally occurring silk fibers, although the structures of nylon and silk are otherwise different. Replacing the flexible –CH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>– units in nylon by aromatic rings produces a stiffer and stronger polymer, such as the very strong polymer known as Kevlar. Kevlar fibers are so strong and rigid that they are used in lightweight army helmets, bulletproof vests, and even sailboat and canoe hulls, all of which contain multiple layers of Kevlar fabric.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p03">Not all synthetic polymers are linked by amide bonds—for example, <em class="emphasis">polyesters</em> contain monomers that are linked by ester bonds. Polyesters are sold under trade names such as Dacron, Kodel, and Fortrel, which are used in clothing, and Mylar, which is used in magnetic tape, helium-filled balloons, and high-tech sails for sailboats. Although the fibers are flexible, properly prepared Mylar films are almost as strong as steel.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p04">Polymers based on skeletons with only carbon are all synthetic. Most of these are formed from ethylene (CH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>=CH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), a two-carbon building block, and its derivatives. The relative lengths of the chains and any branches control the properties of polyethylene. For example, higher numbers of branches produce a softer, more flexible, lower-melting-point polymer called low-density polyethylene (LDPE), whereas high-density polyethylene (HDPE) contains few branches. Substances such as glass that melt at relatively low temperatures can also be formed into fibers, producing <em class="emphasis">fiberglass</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p05">Because most synthetic fibers are neither soluble nor low melting, multistep processes are required to manufacture them and form them into objects. Graphite fibers are formed by heating a precursor polymer at high temperatures to decompose it, a process called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pyrolysis</a><span class="glossdef">A high-temperature decomposition reaction that can be used to form fibers of synthetic polymers.</span></span>. The usual precursor for graphite is polyacrylonitrile, better known by its trade name—Orlon. A similar approach is used to prepare fibers of silicon carbide using an organosilicon precursor such as polydimethylsilane {[–(CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>)<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Si–]<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub>}. A new type of fiber consisting of carbon nanotubes, hollow cylinders of carbon just one atom thick, is lightweight, strong, and impact resistant. Its performance has been compared to that of Kevlar, and it is being considered for use in body armor, flexible solar panels, and bombproof trash bins, among other uses.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s08_s02_p06">Because there are no good polymer precursors for elemental boron or boron nitride, these fibers have to be prepared by time-consuming and costly indirect methods. Even though boron fibers are about eight times stronger than metallic aluminum and 10% lighter, they are significantly more expensive. Consequently, unless an application requires boron’s greater resistance to oxidation, these fibers cannot compete with less costly graphite fibers.</p>
