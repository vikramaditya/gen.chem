The concept of the photon, however, emerged from experimentation with <em class="emphasis">thermal radiation</em>, electromagnetic radiation emitted as the result of a source’s temperature, which produces a continuous spectrum of energies. More direct evidence was needed to verify the quantized nature of electromagnetic radiation. In this section, we describe how experimentation with visible light provided this evidence.</p>

For example, when a high-voltage electrical discharge is passed through a sample of hydrogen gas at low pressure, the resulting individual isolated hydrogen atoms caused by the dissociation of H<sub class="subscript">2</sub> emit a red light. Unlike blackbody radiation, the color of the light emitted by the hydrogen atoms does not depend greatly on the temperature of the gas in the tube. When the emitted light is passed through a prism, only a few narrow lines, called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">line spectrum</a><span class="glossdef">A spectrum in which light of only a certain wavelength is emitted or absorbed, rather than a continuous range of wavelengths.</span></span>, are seen (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_f01">Figure 6.9 "The Emission of Light by Hydrogen Atoms"</a>), rather than a continuous range of colors. The light emitted by hydrogen atoms is red because, of its four characteristic lines, the most intense line in its spectrum is in the red portion of the visible spectrum, at 656 nm. With sodium, however, we observe a yellow color because the most intense lines in its spectrum are in the yellow portion of the spectrum, at about 589 nm.</p>

As <em class="emphasis">n</em> increases, the radius of the orbit increases; the electron is farther from the proton, which results in a less stable arrangement with higher potential energy (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_f01">Figure 6.10 "The Bohr Model of the Hydrogen Atom"</a>). A hydrogen atom with an electron in an orbit with <em class="emphasis">n</em> &gt; 1 is therefore in an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">excited state</a><span class="glossdef">Any arrangement of electrons that is higher in energy than the ground state.</span></span>: its energy is higher than the energy of the ground state. When an atom in an excited state undergoes a transition to the ground state in a process called <em class="emphasis">decay</em>, it loses energy by emitting a photon whose energy corresponds to the difference in energy between the two states (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_f02">Figure 6.11 "The Emission of Light by a Hydrogen Atom in an Excited State"</a>).</p>

As shown in part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_f02">Figure 6.11 "The Emission of Light by a Hydrogen Atom in an Excited State"</a>, the lines in this series correspond to transitions from higher-energy orbits (<em class="emphasis">n</em> &gt; 2) to the <em class="emphasis">second</em> orbit (<em class="emphasis">n</em> = 2). Thus the hydrogen atoms in the sample have absorbed energy from the electrical discharge and decayed from a higher-energy excited state (<em class="emphasis">n</em> &gt; 2) to a lower-energy state (<em class="emphasis">n</em> = 2) by emitting a photon of electromagnetic radiation whose energy corresponds exactly to the <em class="emphasis">difference</em> in energy between the two states (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_f02">Figure 6.11 "The Emission of Light by a Hydrogen Atom in an Excited State"</a>). The <em class="emphasis">n</em> = 3 to <em class="emphasis">n</em> = 2 transition gives rise to the line at 656 nm (red), the <em class="emphasis">n</em> = 4 to <em class="emphasis">n</em> = 2 transition to the line at 486 nm (green), the <em class="emphasis">n</em> = 5 to <em class="emphasis">n</em> = 2 transition to the line at 434 nm (blue), and the <em class="emphasis">n</em> = 6 to <em class="emphasis">n</em> = 2 transition to the line at 410 nm (violet). Because a sample of hydrogen contains a large number of atoms, the intensity of the various lines in a line spectrum depends on the number of atoms in each excited state. At the temperature in the gas discharge tube, more atoms are in the <em class="emphasis">n</em> = 3 than the <em class="emphasis">n</em> ≥ 4 levels. Consequently, the <em class="emphasis">n</em> = 3 to <em class="emphasis">n</em> = 2 transition is the most intense line, producing the characteristic red color of a hydrogen discharge (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_f01">Figure 6.9 "The Emission of Light by Hydrogen Atoms"</a>). Other families of lines are produced by transitions from excited states with <em class="emphasis">n</em> &gt; 1 to the orbit with <em class="emphasis">n</em> = 1 or to orbits with <em class="emphasis">n</em> ≥ 3. These transitions are shown schematically in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_f03">Figure 6.12 "Electron Transitions Responsible for the Various Series of Lines Observed in the Emission Spectrum of Hydrogen"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p10">In contemporary applications, electron transitions are used in timekeeping that needs to be exact. Telecommunications systems, such as cell phones, depend on timing signals that are accurate to within a millionth of a second per day, as are the devices that control the US power grid. Global positioning system (GPS) signals must be accurate to within a billionth of a second per day, which is equivalent to gaining or losing no more than one second in 1,400,000 years. Quantifying time requires finding an event with an interval that repeats on a regular basis. To achieve the accuracy required for modern purposes, physicists have turned to the atom. The current standard used to calibrate clocks is the cesium atom. Supercooled cesium atoms are placed in a vacuum chamber and bombarded with microwaves whose frequencies are carefully controlled. When the frequency is exactly right, the atoms absorb enough energy to undergo an electronic transition to a higher-energy state. Decay to a lower-energy state emits radiation. The microwave frequency is continually adjusted, serving as the clock’s pendulum. In 1967, the second was defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 oscillations of the resonant frequency of a cesium atom, called the <em class="emphasis">cesium clock</em>. Research is currently under way to develop the next generation of atomic clocks that promise to be even more accurate. Such devices would allow scientists to monitor vanishingly faint electromagnetic signals produced by nerve pathways in the brain and geologists to measure variations in gravitational fields, which cause fluctuations in time, that would aid in the discovery of oil or minerals.</p>

In particular, astronomers use emission and absorption spectra to determine the composition of stars and interstellar matter. As an example, consider the spectrum of sunlight shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_f01">Figure 6.14 "The Visible Spectrum of Sunlight"</a>. Because the sun is very hot, the light it emits is in the form of a continuous emission spectrum. Superimposed on it, however, is a series of dark lines due primarily to the absorption of specific frequencies of light by cooler atoms in the outer atmosphere of the sun. By comparing these lines with the spectra of elements measured on Earth, we now know that the sun contains large amounts of hydrogen, iron, and carbon, along with smaller amounts of other elements. During the solar eclipse of 1868, the French astronomer Pierre Janssen (1824–1907) observed a set of lines that did not match those of any known element. He suggested that they were due to the presence of a new element, which he named <em class="emphasis">helium</em>, from the Greek <em class="emphasis">helios</em>, meaning “sun.” Helium was finally discovered in uranium ores on Earth in 1895.</p>

Similarly, the blue and yellow colors of certain street lights are caused, respectively, by mercury and sodium discharges. In all these cases, an electrical discharge excites neutral atoms to a higher energy state, and light is emitted when the atoms decay to the ground state. In the case of mercury, most of the emission lines are below 450 nm, which produces a blue light (part (c) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_f04">Figure 6.13 "The Emission Spectra of Elements Compared with Hydrogen"</a>).

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_s01_p01">The colors of fireworks are also due to atomic emission spectra. As shown in part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_s01_f01">Figure 6.15 "The Chemistry of Fireworks"</a>, a typical shell used in a fireworks display contains gunpowder to propel the shell into the air and a fuse to initiate a variety of redox reactions that produce heat and small explosions. Thermal energy excites the atoms to higher energy states; as they decay to lower energy states, the atoms emit light that gives the familiar colors. When oxidant/reductant mixtures listed in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_s01_t01">Table 6.2 "Common Chemicals Used in the Manufacture of Fireworks*"</a> are ignited, a flash of white or yellow light is produced along with a loud bang. Achieving the colors shown in part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_s01_f01">Figure 6.15 "The Chemistry of Fireworks"</a> requires adding a small amount of a substance that has an emission spectrum in the desired portion of the visible spectrum. For example, sodium is used for yellow because of its 589 nm emission lines. The intense yellow color of sodium would mask most other colors, so potassium and ammonium salts, rather than sodium salts, are usually used as oxidants to produce other colors, which explains the preponderance of such salts in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_s01_t01">Table 6.2 "Common Chemicals Used in the Manufacture of Fireworks*"</a>. Strontium salts, which are also used in highway flares, emit red light, whereas barium gives a green color. Blue is one of the most difficult colors to achieve. Copper(II) salts emit a pale blue light, but copper is dangerous to use because it forms highly unstable explosive compounds with anions such as chlorate. As you might guess, preparing fireworks with the desired properties is a complex, challenging, and potentially hazardous process.</p>

Lasers have many applications in fiber-optic telecommunications, the reading and recording of compact discs (CDs) and digital video discs (DVDs), steel cutting, and supermarket checkout scanners. Laser beams are generated by the same general phenomenon that gives rise to emission spectra, with one difference: only a single excited state is produced, which in principle results in only a single frequency of emitted light. In practice, however, inexpensive commercial lasers actually emit light with a very narrow range of wavelengths.</p>

(From the laser’s point of view, pits are actually the “bumps” shown here because the master disc with pits is duplicated negatively, turning the pits into bumps.) Pits have the same light-reflecting surface as land, but there are differences in the frequencies of the reflected light in the pit and the land, making light reflected by pits relatively dark compared with light reflected by land.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_s02_p02">The operation of a ruby laser, the first type of laser used commercially, is shown schematically in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_s02_f01">Figure 6.16 "A Ruby Laser"</a>. Ruby is an impure form of aluminum oxide (Al<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">3</sub>) in which Cr<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> replaces some of the Al<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> ions. The red color of the gem is caused by the absorption of light in the blue region of the visible spectrum by Cr<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> ions, which leaves only the longer wavelengths to be reflected back to the eye. One end of a ruby bar is coated with a fully reflecting mirror, and the mirror on the other end is only partially reflecting. When flashes of white light from a flash lamp excite the Cr<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> ions, they initially decay to a relatively long-lived excited state and can subsequently decay to the ground state by emitting a photon of red light. Some of these photons are reflected back and forth by the mirrored surfaces. As shown in part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_s02_f01">Figure 6.16 "A Ruby Laser"</a>, each time a photon interacts with an excited Cr<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> ion, it can stimulate that ion to emit another photon that has the same wavelength and is synchronized (<em class="emphasis">in phase</em>) with the first wave. This process produces a <em class="emphasis">cascade</em> of photons traveling back and forth, until the intense beam emerges through the partially reflecting mirror. Ruby is only one substance that is used to produce a laser; the choice of material determines the wavelength of light emitted, from infrared to ultraviolet, and the light output can be either continuous or pulsed.</p>

                <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_s02_p04">Atoms of individual elements emit light at only specific wavelengths, producing a <strong class="emphasis bold">line spectrum</strong> rather than the continuous spectrum of all wavelengths produced by a hot object. Niels Bohr explained the line spectrum of the hydrogen atom by assuming that the electron moved in circular orbits and that orbits with only certain radii were allowed. Lines in the spectrum were due to transitions in which an electron moved from a higher-energy orbit with a larger radius to a lower-energy orbit with smaller radius. The orbit closest to the nucleus represented the <strong class="emphasis bold">ground state</strong> of the atom and was most stable; orbits farther away were higher-energy <strong class="emphasis bold">excited states</strong>. Transitions from an excited state to a lower-energy state resulted in the emission of light with only a limited number of wavelengths. Bohr’s model could not, however, explain the spectra of atoms heavier than hydrogen.</p>
                <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_s02_p05">Most light is polychromatic and contains light of many wavelengths. Light that has only a single wavelength is monochromatic and is produced by devices called lasers, which use transitions between two atomic energy levels to produce light in a very narrow range of wavelengths. Atoms can also absorb light of certain energies, resulting in a transition from the ground state or a lower-energy excited state to a higher-energy excited state. This produces an <strong class="emphasis bold">absorption spectrum</strong>, which has dark lines in the same position as the bright lines in the <strong class="emphasis bold">emission spectrum</strong> of an element.</p>
