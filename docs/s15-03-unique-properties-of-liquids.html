    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s03_p01">Although you have been introduced to some of the interactions that hold molecules together in a liquid, we have not yet discussed the consequences of those interactions for the bulk properties of liquids. We now turn our attention to three unique properties of liquids that intimately depend on the nature of intermolecular interactions: surface tension, capillary action, and viscosity.</p>
    <div class="section" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Surface Tension</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p01">We stated in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch11_s01#averill_1.0-ch11_s01">Section 11.1 "The Kinetic Molecular Description of Liquids"</a> that liquids tend to adopt the shapes of their containers. Why, then, do small amounts of water on a freshly waxed car form raised droplets instead of a thin, continuous film? The answer lies in a property called <em class="emphasis">surface tension</em>, which depends on intermolecular forces.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p02"><a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_f01">Figure 11.9 "A Representation of Surface Tension in a Liquid"</a> presents a microscopic view of a liquid droplet. A typical molecule in the <em class="emphasis">interior</em> of the droplet is surrounded by other molecules that exert attractive forces from all directions. Consequently, there is no <em class="emphasis">net</em> force on the molecule that would cause it to move in a particular direction. In contrast, a molecule on the <em class="emphasis">surface</em> experiences a net attraction toward the drop because there are no molecules on the outside to balance the forces exerted by adjacent molecules in the interior. Because a sphere has the smallest possible surface area for a given volume, intermolecular attractive interactions between water molecules cause the droplet to adopt a spherical shape. This maximizes the number of attractive interactions and minimizes the number of water molecules at the surface. Hence raindrops are almost spherical, and drops of water on a waxed (nonpolar) surface, which does not interact strongly with water, form round beads (see the chapter opener photo). A dirty car is covered with a mixture of substances, some of which are polar. Attractive interactions between the polar substances and water cause the water to spread out into a thin film instead of forming beads.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p03">The same phenomenon holds molecules together at the surface of a bulk sample of water, almost as if they formed a skin. When filling a glass with water, the glass can be overfilled so that the level of the liquid actually extends <em class="emphasis">above</em> the rim. Similarly, a sewing needle or a paper clip can be placed on the surface of a glass of water where it “floats,” even though steel is much denser than water (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_f02">Figure 11.10 "The Effects of the High Surface Tension of Liquid Water"</a>). Many insects take advantage of this property to walk on the surface of puddles or ponds without sinking (part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_f02">Figure 11.10 "The Effects of the High Surface Tension of Liquid Water"</a>).</p>

Surface tension is measured in units of energy per area (e.g., <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="averill_1.0-ch11_m004" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mtext>J</mtext><mo>/</mo><msup><mtext>m</mtext><mtext>2</mtext></msup></mrow></semantics></math></span>).</span></span>, which is defined as the energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid by a specific amount. Surface tension is therefore measured as energy per unit area, such as joules per square meter (J/m<sup class="superscript">2</sup>) or dyne per centimeter (dyn/cm), where 1 dyn = 1 × 10<sup class="superscript">−5</sup> N. The values of the surface tension of some representative liquids are listed in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_t01">Table 11.4 "Surface Tension, Viscosity, Vapor Pressure (at 25°C Unless Otherwise Indicated), and Normal Boiling Points of Common Liquids"</a>. Note the correlation between the surface tension of a liquid and the strength of the intermolecular forces: the stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher the surface tension. For example, water, with its strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, has one of the highest surface tension values of any liquid, whereas low-boiling-point organic molecules, which have relatively weak intermolecular forces, have much lower surface tensions. Mercury is an apparent anomaly, but its very high surface tension is due to the presence of strong metallic bonding, which we will discuss in more detail in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12#averill_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Solids"</a>.</p>

In the 1960s, US Navy researchers developed a method of fighting fires aboard aircraft carriers using “foams,” which are aqueous solutions of fluorinated surfactants. The surfactants reduce the surface tension of water below that of fuel, so the fluorinated solution is able to spread across the burning surface and extinguish the fire. Such foams are now used universally to fight large-scale fires of organic liquids.</p>

Water has both strong adhesion to glass, which contains polar SiOH groups, and strong intermolecular cohesion. When a glass capillary is put into water, the surface tension due to cohesive forces constricts the surface area of water within the tube, while adhesion between the water and the glass creates an upward force that maximizes the amount of glass surface in contact with the water. If the adhesive forces are stronger than the cohesive forces, as is the case for water, then the liquid in the capillary rises to the level where the downward force of gravity exactly balances this upward force. If, however, the cohesive forces are stronger than the adhesive forces, as is the case for mercury and glass, the liquid pulls itself down into the capillary below the surface of the bulk liquid to minimize contact with the glass (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_f02">Figure 11.12 "The Effects of Capillary Action"</a>).

Plants contain tiny rigid tubes composed of cellulose, to which water has strong adhesion. Because of the strong adhesive forces, nutrients can be transported from the roots to the tops of trees that are more than 50 m tall. Cotton towels are also made of cellulose; they absorb water because the tiny tubes act like capillaries and “wick” the water away from your skin.

The higher the viscosity, the slower the liquid flows through the tube and the steel balls fall. Viscosity is expressed in units of the poise (mPa·s); the higher the number, the higher the viscosity. The viscosities of some representative liquids are listed in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_t01">Table 11.4 "Surface Tension, Viscosity, Vapor Pressure (at 25°C Unless Otherwise Indicated), and Normal Boiling Points of Common Liquids"</a> and show a correlation between viscosity and intermolecular forces. Because a liquid can flow only if the molecules can move past one another with minimal resistance, strong intermolecular attractive forces make it more difficult for molecules to move with respect to one another. The addition of a second hydroxyl group to ethanol, for example, which produces ethylene glycol (HOCH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>CH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>OH), increases the viscosity 15-fold. This effect is due to the increased number of hydrogen bonds that can form between hydroxyl groups in adjacent molecules, resulting in dramatically stronger intermolecular attractive forces.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s03_p02">There is also a correlation between viscosity and molecular shape. Liquids consisting of long, flexible molecules tend to have higher viscosities than those composed of more spherical or shorter-chain molecules. The longer the molecules, the easier it is for them to become “tangled” with one another, making it more difficult for them to move past one another. London dispersion forces also increase with chain length. Due to a combination of these two effects, long-chain hydrocarbons (such as motor oils) are highly viscous.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s03_p04">Motor oils and other lubricants demonstrate the practical importance of controlling viscosity. The oil in an automobile engine must effectively lubricate under a wide range of conditions, from subzero starting temperatures to the 200°C that oil can reach in an engine in the heat of the Mojave Desert in August. Viscosity decreases rapidly with increasing temperatures because the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, and higher kinetic energy enables the molecules to overcome the attractive forces that prevent the liquid from flowing. As a result, an oil that is thin enough to be a good lubricant in a cold engine will become too “thin” (have too low a viscosity) to be effective at high temperatures. The viscosity of motor oils is described by an SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) rating ranging from SAE 5 to SAE 50 for engine oils: the lower the number, the lower the viscosity. So-called <em class="emphasis">single-grade oils</em> can cause major problems. If they are viscous enough to work at high operating temperatures (SAE 50, for example), then at low temperatures, they can be so viscous that a car is difficult to start or an engine is not properly lubricated. Consequently, most modern oils are <em class="emphasis">multigrade</em>, with designations such as SAE 20W/50 (a grade used in high-performance sports cars), in which case the oil has the viscosity of an SAE 20 oil at subzero temperatures (hence the W for winter) and the viscosity of an SAE 50 oil at high temperatures. These properties are achieved by a careful blend of additives that modulate the intermolecular interactions in the oil, thereby controlling the temperature dependence of the viscosity. Many of the commercially available oil additives “for improved engine performance” are highly viscous materials that increase the viscosity and effective SAE rating of the oil, but overusing these additives can cause the same problems experienced with highly viscous single-grade oils.</p>

                        <p class="para">The plots of surface tension versus temperature for propionic acid and isopropanol have essentially the same slope, but at all temperatures the surface tension of propionic acid is about 30% greater than for isopropanol. Because surface tension is a measure of the cohesive forces in a liquid, these data suggest that the cohesive forces for propionic acid are significantly greater than for isopropanol. Both substances consist of polar molecules with similar molecular masses, and the most important intermolecular interactions are likely to be dipole–dipole interactions. Consequently, these data suggest that propionic acid is more polar than isopropanol.</p>
