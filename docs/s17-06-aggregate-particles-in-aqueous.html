    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s06_p01">Suspensions and colloids are two common types of mixtures whose properties are in many ways intermediate between those of true solutions and heterogeneous mixtures. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">suspension</a><span class="glossdef">A heterogeneous mixture of particles with diameters of about 1 µm that are distributed throughout a second phase and that separate from the dispersing phase on standing.</span></span> is a heterogeneous mixture of particles with diameters of about 1 µm (1000 nm) that are distributed throughout a second phase. Common suspensions include paint, blood, and hot chocolate, which are solid particles in a liquid, and aerosol sprays, which are liquid particles in a gas. If the suspension is allowed to stand, the two phases will separate, which is why paints must be thoroughly stirred or shaken before use. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">colloid</a><span class="glossdef">A heterogeneous mixture of particles with diameters of about 2–500 nm that are distributed throughout a second phase and do not separate from the dispersing phase on standing.</span></span> is also a heterogeneous mixture, but the particles of a colloid are typically smaller than those of a suspension, generally in the range of 2 to about 500 nm in diameter. Colloids include fog and clouds (liquid particles in a gas), milk (solid particles in a liquid), and butter (solid particles in a solid). Other colloids are used industrially as catalysts. Unlike in a suspension, the particles in a colloid do not separate into two phases on standing. The only combination of substances that cannot produce a suspension or a colloid is a mixture of two gases because their particles are so small that they always form true solutions. The properties of suspensions, colloids, and solutions are summarized in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch13_s06_t01">Table 13.9 "Properties of Liquid Solutions, Colloids, and Suspensions"</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Colloids and Suspensions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_p01">Colloids were first characterized in about 1860 by Thomas Graham, who also gave us Graham’s law of diffusion and effusion. Although some substances, such as starch, gelatin, and glue, appear to dissolve in water to produce solutions, Graham found that they diffuse very slowly or not at all compared with solutions of substances such as salt and sugar. Graham coined the word <em class="emphasis">colloid</em> (from the Greek <em class="emphasis">kólla</em>, meaning “glue”) to describe these substances, as well as the words <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sol</a><span class="glossdef">A dispersion of solid particles in a liquid or solid.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gel</a><span class="glossdef">A semisolid sol in which all of the liquid phase has been absorbed by the solid particles.</span></span> to describe certain types of colloids in which all of the solvent has been absorbed by the solid particles, thus preventing the mixture from flowing readily, as we see in Jell-O. Two other important types of colloids are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">aerosols</a><span class="glossdef">A dispersion of solid or liquid particles in a gas.</span></span>, which are dispersions of solid or liquid particles in a gas, and emulsions, which are dispersions of one liquid in another liquid with which it is immiscible.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_p02">Colloids share many properties with solutions. For example, the particles in both are invisible without a powerful microscope, do not settle on standing, and pass through most filters. However, the particles in a colloid scatter a beam of visible light, a phenomenon known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Tyndall effect</a><span class="glossdef">The phenomenon of scattering a beam of visible light.</span></span>,<span class="footnote" id="averill_1.0-fn13_004">The effect is named after its discoverer, John Tyndall, an English physicist (1820–1893).</span> whereas the particles of a solution do not. The Tyndall effect is responsible for the way the beams from automobile headlights are clearly visible from the side on a foggy night but cannot be seen from the side on a clear night. It is also responsible for the colored rays of light seen in many sunsets, where the sun’s light is scattered by water droplets and dust particles high in the atmosphere. An example of the Tyndall effect is shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_f01">Figure 13.22 "Tyndall Effect, the Scattering of Light by Colloids"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para">Both cylinders contain a solution of red food coloring in water, but a small amount of gelatin has been added to the cylinder on the right to form a colloidal suspension of gelatin particles. The beam of light goes straight through the true solution on the left, but the light beam is scattered by the colloid on the right.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_p03">Although colloids and suspensions can have particles similar in size, the two differ in stability: the particles of a colloid remain dispersed indefinitely unless the temperature or chemical composition of the dispersing medium is changed. The chemical explanation for the stability of colloids depends on whether the colloidal particles are hydrophilic or hydrophobic.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_p04">Most proteins, including those responsible for the properties of gelatin and glue, are hydrophilic because their exterior surface is largely covered with polar or charged groups. Starch, a long-branched polymer of glucose molecules, is also hydrophilic. A hydrophilic colloid particle interacts strongly with water, resulting in a shell of tightly bound water molecules that prevents the particles from aggregating when they collide. Heating such a colloid can cause aggregation because the particles collide with greater energy and disrupt the protective shell of solvent. Moreover, heat causes protein structures to unfold, exposing previously buried hydrophobic groups that can now interact with other hydrophobic groups and cause the particles to aggregate and precipitate from solution. When an egg is boiled, for example, the egg white, which is primarily a colloidal suspension of a protein called <em class="emphasis">albumin</em>, unfolds and exposes its hydrophobic groups, which aggregate and cause the albumin to precipitate as a white solid.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_p05">In some cases, a stable colloid can be transformed to an aggregated suspension by a minor chemical modification. Consider, for example, the behavior of hemoglobin, a major component of red blood cells. Hemoglobin molecules normally form a colloidal suspension inside red blood cells, which typically have a “donut” shape and are easily deformed, allowing them to squeeze through the capillaries to deliver oxygen to tissues. In a common inherited disease called sickle-cell anemia, one of the amino acids in hemoglobin that has a hydrophilic carboxylic acid side chain (glutamate) is replaced by another amino acid that has a hydrophobic side chain (valine, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch05_s04#averill_1.0-ch05_s04_f01">Figure 5.16 "The Structures of 10 Amino Acids"</a>). Under some conditions, the abnormal hemoglobin molecules can aggregate to form long, rigid fibers that cause the red blood cells to deform, adopting a characteristic sickle shape that prevents them from passing through the capillaries (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_f02">Figure 13.23 "Sickle-Cell Anemia"</a>). The reduction in blood flow results in severe cramps, swollen joints, and liver damage. Until recently, many patients with sickle-cell anemia died before the age of 30 from infection, blood clots, or heart or kidney failure, although individuals with the sickle-cell genetic trait are more resistant to malaria than are those with “normal” hemoglobin.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_p06">Aggregation and precipitation can also result when the outer, charged layer of a particle is neutralized by ions with the opposite charge. In inland waterways, clay particles, which have a charged surface, form a colloidal suspension. High salt concentrations in seawater neutralize the charge on the particles, causing them to precipitate and form land at the mouths of large rivers, as seen in the satellite view in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_f03">Figure 13.24 "Formation of New Land by the Destabilization of a Colloid Suspension"</a>. Charge neutralization is also an important strategy for precipitating solid particles from gaseous colloids such as smoke, and it is widely used to reduce particulate emissions from power plants that burn fossil fuels.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch13_s06_s02_p03">When you wash your laundry, the hydrophobic tails of soaps and detergents interact with hydrophobic particles of dirt or grease through dispersion forces, dissolving in the interior of the hydrophobic particle. The hydrophilic group is then exposed at the surface of the particle, which enables it to interact with water through ion–dipole forces and hydrogen bonding. This causes the particles of dirt or grease to disperse in the wash water and allows them to be removed by rinsing. Similar agents are used in the food industry to stabilize emulsions such as mayonnaise.</p>
