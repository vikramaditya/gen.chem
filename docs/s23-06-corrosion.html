For example, when exposed to air, iron rusts, silver tarnishes, and copper and brass acquire a bluish-green surface called a <em class="emphasis">patina</em>. Of the various metals subject to corrosion, iron is by far the most important commercially. An estimated $100 billion per year is spent in the United States alone to replace iron-containing objects destroyed by corrosion. Consequently, the development of methods for protecting metal surfaces from corrosion constitutes a very active area of industrial research. In this section, we describe some of the chemical and electrochemical processes responsible for corrosion. We also examine the chemical basis for some common methods for preventing corrosion and treating corroded metals.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch19_s06_p03">Under ambient conditions, the oxidation of most metals is thermodynamically spontaneous, with the notable exception of gold and platinum. Hence it is actually somewhat surprising that any metals are useful at all in Earth’s moist, oxygen-rich atmosphere. Some metals, however, are resistant to corrosion for kinetic reasons. For example, aluminum in soft-drink cans and airplanes is protected by a thin coating of metal oxide that forms on the surface of the metal and acts as an impenetrable barrier that prevents further destruction. Aluminum cans also have a thin plastic layer to prevent reaction of the oxide with acid in the soft drink. Chromium, magnesium, and nickel also form protective oxide films. Stainless steels are remarkably resistant to corrosion because they usually contain a significant proportion of chromium, nickel, or both.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch19_s06_p04">In contrast to these metals, when iron corrodes, it forms a red-brown hydrated metal oxide (Fe<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">3</sub>·<em class="emphasis">x</em>H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O), commonly known as <em class="emphasis">rust</em>, that does not provide a tight protective film (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch19_s06_f01">Figure 19.17 "Rust, the Result of Corrosion of Metallic Iron"</a>). Instead, the rust continually flakes off to expose a fresh metal surface vulnerable to reaction with oxygen and water. Because both oxygen and water are required for rust to form, an iron nail immersed in deoxygenated water will not rust—even over a period of several weeks. Similarly, a nail immersed in an organic solvent such as kerosene or mineral oil saturated with oxygen will not rust because of the absence of water.</p>

Automobile manufacturers spend a great deal of time and money developing paints that adhere tightly to the car’s metal surface to prevent oxygenated water, acid, and salt from coming into contact with the underlying metal. Unfortunately, even the best paint is subject to scratching or denting, and the electrochemical nature of the corrosion process means that two scratches relatively remote from each other can operate together as anode and cathode, leading to sudden mechanical failure (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch19_s06_f02">Figure 19.18 "Small Scratches in a Protective Paint Coating Can Lead to the Rapid Corrosion of Iron"</a>).</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch19_s06_p08">One of the most common techniques used to prevent the corrosion of iron is applying a protective coating of another metal that is more difficult to oxidize. Faucets and some external parts of automobiles, for example, are often coated with a thin layer of chromium using an electrolytic process that will be discussed in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch19_s07#averill_1.0-ch19_s07">Section 19.7 "Electrolysis"</a>. With the increased use of polymeric materials in cars, however, the use of chrome-plated steel has diminished in recent years. Similarly, the “tin cans” that hold soups and other foods are actually made of steel coated with a thin layer of tin. Neither chromium nor tin is intrinsically resistant to corrosion, but both form protective oxide coatings.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch19_s06_p09">As with a protective paint, scratching a protective metal coating will allow corrosion to occur. In this case, however, the presence of the second metal can actually increase the rate of corrosion. The values of the standard electrode potentials for Sn<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> (<em class="emphasis">E</em>° = −0.14 V) and Fe<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> (<em class="emphasis">E</em>° = −0.45 V) in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch19_s03#averill_1.0-ch19_s03_t01">Table 19.2 "Standard Potentials for Selected Reduction Half-Reactions at 25°C"</a> show that Fe is more easily oxidized than Sn. As a result, the more corrosion-resistant metal (in this case, tin) accelerates the corrosion of iron by acting as the cathode and providing a large surface area for the reduction of oxygen (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch19_s06_f03">Figure 19.19 "Galvanic Corrosion"</a>). This process is seen in some older homes where copper and iron pipes have been directly connected to each other. The less easily oxidized copper acts as the cathode, causing iron to dissolve rapidly near the connection and occasionally resulting in a catastrophic plumbing failure.</p>

        <p class="para">If iron is in contact with a more corrosion-resistant metal such as tin, copper, or lead, the other metal can act as a large cathode that greatly increases the rate of reduction of oxygen. Because the reduction of oxygen is coupled to the oxidation of iron, this can result in a dramatic increase in the rate at which iron is oxidized at the anode. Galvanic corrosion is likely to occur whenever two dissimilar metals are connected directly, allowing electrons to be transferred from one to the other.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch19_s06_p10">One way to avoid these problems is to use a more easily oxidized metal to protect iron from corrosion. In this approach, called <em class="emphasis">cathodic protection</em>, a more reactive metal such as Zn (<em class="emphasis">E</em>° = −0.76 V for Zn<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> + 2e<sup class="superscript">−</sup> → Zn) becomes the anode, and iron becomes the cathode. This prevents oxidation of the iron and protects the iron object from corrosion. The reactions that occur under these conditions are as follows:</p>

        <p class="para">Connecting a magnesium rod to an underground steel pipeline protects the pipeline from corrosion. Because magnesium (<em class="emphasis">E</em>° = −2.37 V) is much more easily oxidized than iron (<em class="emphasis">E</em>° = −0.45 V), the Mg rod acts as the anode in a galvanic cell. The pipeline is therefore forced to act as the cathode at which oxygen is reduced. The soil between the anode and the cathode acts as a salt bridge that completes the electrical circuit and maintains electrical neutrality. As Mg(s) is oxidized to Mg<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> at the anode, anions in the soil, such as nitrate, diffuse toward the anode to neutralize the positive charge. Simultaneously, cations in the soil, such as H<sup class="superscript">+</sup> or NH<sub class="subscript">4</sub><sup class="superscript">+</sup>, diffuse toward the cathode, where they replenish the protons that are consumed as oxygen is reduced. A similar strategy uses many miles of somewhat less reactive zinc wire to protect the Alaska oil pipeline.</p>

Because zinc is a more active metal than iron, it will act as the sacrificial anode in the electrochemical cell and dissolve (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch19_s06_eq07" xrefstyle="select:label">Equation 19.102</a>).</li>
