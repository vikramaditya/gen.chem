    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_p01">Periodic trends in properties such as atomic size and ionic size, ionization energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity illustrate the strong connection between the <strong class="emphasis bold">chemical properties</strong> and the reactivity of the elements and their positions in the periodic table. In this section, we explore that connection by focusing on two periodic properties that correlate strongly with the chemical behavior of the elements: valence electron configurations and Mulliken electronegativities.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Main Group Elements</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_p01">We have said that elements with the same valence electron configuration (i.e., elements in the same column of the periodic table) often have similar chemistry. This correlation is particularly evident for the elements of groups 1, 2, 3, 13, 16, 17, and 18. The intervening families in the <em class="emphasis">p</em> block (groups 14 and 15) straddle the diagonal line separating metals from nonmetals. The lightest members of these two families are nonmetals, so they react differently compared to the heaviest members, which are metals. We begin our survey with the alkali metals (group 1), which contain only a single electron outside a noble gas electron configuration, and end with the noble gases (group 18), which have full valence electron shells.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p01">The elements of group 1 are called the <em class="emphasis">alkali metals</em>. <em class="emphasis">Alkali</em> (from the Arabic <em class="emphasis">al-qili</em>, meaning “ashes of the saltwort plant from salt marshes”) was a general term for substances derived from wood ashes, all of which possessed a bitter taste and were able to neutralize acids. Although oxides of both group 1 and group 2 elements were obtained from wood ashes, the alkali metals had lower melting points.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p02">Potassium and sodium were first isolated in 1807 by the British chemist Sir Humphry Davy (1778–1829) by passing an electrical current through molten samples of potash (K<sub class="subscript">2</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>) and soda ash (Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>). The potassium burst into flames as soon as it was produced because it reacts readily with oxygen at the higher temperature. However, the group 1 elements, like the group 2 elements, become less reactive with air or water as their atomic number decreases. The heaviest element (francium) was not discovered until 1939. It is so radioactive that studying its chemistry is very difficult.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p03">The alkali metals have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup> valence electron configurations and the lowest electronegativity of any group; hence they are often referred to as being <em class="emphasis">electropositive</em> elements. As a result, they have a strong tendency to lose their single valence electron to form compounds in the +1 oxidation state, producing the EX monohalides and the E<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O oxides.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p04">Because they are so reactive, pure group 1 elements are powerful reducing agents that are used in lithium batteries and cardiac pacemakers. Sodium salts such as common table salt (NaCl), baking soda (NaHCO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>), soda ash (Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>CO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>), and caustic soda (NaOH) are important industrial chemicals. Other compounds of the alkali metals are important in biology. For example, because potassium is required for plant growth, its compounds are used in fertilizers, and lithium salts are used to treat manic-depressive, or bipolar, disorders.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s02_p01">The elements of group 2 are collectively referred to as the <em class="emphasis">alkaline earth metals</em>, a name that originated in the Middle Ages, when an “earth” was defined as a substance that did not melt and was not transformed by fire. Alkalis that did not melt easily were called “alkaline earths.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s02_p02">Recall that the trend in most groups is for the lightest member to have properties that are quite different from those of the heavier members. Consistent with this trend, the properties of the lightest element—in this case, beryllium—tend to be different from those of its heavier <em class="emphasis">congeners</em>, the other members of the group. Beryllium is relatively unreactive but forms many covalent compounds, whereas the other group members are much more reactive metals and form ionic compounds. As is the case with the alkali metals, the heaviest element, radium, is highly radioactive, making its size difficult to measure. Radium was discovered in 1902 by Marie Curie (1867–1934; Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1903 and Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1911), who, with her husband, Pierre, isolated 120 mg of radium chloride from tons of residues from uranium mining. (For more information about radioactivity, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01#averill_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Chemistry"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01_s05#averill_1.0-ch01_s05">Section 1.5 "The Atom"</a>.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s02_p03">All the alkaline earth metals have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup> valence electron configurations, and all have electronegativities less than 1.6. This means that they behave chemically as metals (although beryllium compounds are covalent) and lose the two valence electrons to form compounds in the +2 oxidation state. Examples include the dihalides (EX<sub class="subscript">2</sub>) and the oxides (EO).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s02_p04">Compounds of the group 2 elements have been commercially important since Egyptian and Roman times, when blocks of limestone or marble, which are both CaCO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>, were used as building materials, and gypsum (CaSO<sub class="subscript">4</sub>·2 H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O) or lime (CaO) was used as mortar. Calcium sulfate is still used in Portland cement and plaster of Paris. Magnesium and beryllium form lightweight, high-strength alloys that are used in the aerospace, automotive, and other high-tech industries. As you learned in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch06#averill_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "The Structure of Atoms"</a>, one of the most impressive uses of these elements is in fireworks; strontium and barium salts, for example, give red or green colors, respectively. Except for beryllium, which is highly toxic, the group 2 elements are also important biologically. Bone is largely hydroxyapatite [Ca<sub class="subscript">5</sub>(PO<sub class="subscript">4</sub>)<sub class="subscript">3</sub>OH], mollusk shells are calcium carbonate, magnesium is part of the chlorophyll molecule in green plants, and calcium is important in hormonal and nerve signal transmission. Because BaSO<sub class="subscript">4</sub> is so insoluble, it is used in “barium milk shakes” to obtain x-rays of the gastrointestinal tract.</p>

Thus boron is a semimetal, whereas the rest of the group 13 elements are metals. Elemental boron has an unusual structure consisting of B<sub class="subscript">12</sub> icosahedra covalently bonded to one another; the other elements are typical metallic solids.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s03_p02">No group 13 elements were known in ancient times, not because they are scarce—Al is the third most abundant element in Earth’s crust—but because they are highly reactive and form extremely stable compounds with oxygen. To isolate the pure elements, potent reducing agents and careful handling were needed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s03_p03">The elements of group 13 have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup> valence electron configurations. Consequently, two oxidation states are important: +3, from losing three valence electrons to give the closed-shell electron configuration of the preceding noble gas; and +1, from losing the single electron in the <em class="emphasis">np</em> subshell. Because these elements have small, negative electron affinities (boron’s is only −27.0 kJ/mol), they are unlikely to acquire five electrons to reach the next noble gas configuration. In fact, the chemistry of these elements is almost exclusively characterized by +3. Only the heaviest element (Tl) has extensive chemistry in the +1 oxidation state. It loses the single 6<em class="emphasis">p</em> electron to produce TlX monohalides and the oxide Tl<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s03_p04">In the 19th century, aluminum was considered a precious metal. In fact, it was considered so precious that aluminum knives and forks were reserved for the French Emperor Louis Napoleon III, while his less important guests had to be content with gold or silver cutlery. Because of the metal’s rarity the dedication of the Washington Monument in 1885 was celebrated by placing a 100 oz chunk of pure aluminum at the top. In contrast, today aluminum is used on an enormous scale in aircraft, automobile engines, armor, cookware, and beverage containers. It is valued for its combination of low density, high strength, and corrosion resistance. Aluminum is also found in compounds that are the active ingredients in most antiperspirant deodorants.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s03_p05">Compounds of boron, such as one form of BN, are hard, have a high melting point, and are resistant to corrosion. They are particularly useful in materials that are exposed to extreme conditions, such as aircraft turbines, brake linings, and polishing compounds. Boron is also a major component of many kinds of glasses, and sodium perborate [Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>B<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">4</sub>(OH)<sub class="subscript">4</sub>] is the active ingredient in many so-called color-safe laundry bleaches.</p>

Of the elements in this group, carbon is a nonmetal, silicon and germanium are semimetals, and tin and lead are metals.

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s04_p03">The electronegativity of carbon is only 2.5, placing it in the middle of the electronegativity range, so carbon forms covalent compounds with a wide variety of elements and is the basis of all organic compounds. All of the group 14 elements form compounds in the +4 oxidation state, so all of them are able to form dioxides (from CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> to PbO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>) and tetrachlorides (CCl<sub class="subscript">4</sub> and PbCl<sub class="subscript">4</sub>). Only the two metallic elements, Sn and Pb, form an extensive series of compounds in the +2 oxidation state. Tin salts are sprayed onto glass to make an electrically conductive coating, and then the glass is used in the manufacture of frost-free windshields. Lead sulfate is formed when your car battery discharges.</p>

Graphite consists of extended planes of covalently bonded hexagonal rings. Because the planes are not linked by covalent bonds, they can slide across one another easily. This makes graphite ideally suited as a lubricant and as the “lead” in lead pencils. Graphite also provides the black color in inks and tires, and graphite fibers are used in high-tech items such as golf clubs, tennis rackets, airplanes, and sailboats because of their lightweight, strength, and stiffness.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s04_p05">In contrast to the layered structure of graphite, each carbon atom in diamond is bonded to four others to form a rigid three-dimensional array, making diamond one of the hardest substances known; consequently, it is used in industry as a cutting tool. Fullerenes, on the other hand, are spherical or ellipsoidal molecules with six- and five-membered rings of carbon atoms; they are volatile substances that dissolve in organic solvents. Fullerenes of extraterrestrial origin have been found in meteorites and have been discovered in a cloud of cosmic dust surrounding a distant star, which makes them the largest molecules ever seen in space. Carbon nanotubes, intermediate in structure between graphite and the fullerenes, can be described as sheets of graphite that have been rolled up into a cylinder or, alternatively, fullerene cages that have been stretched in one direction. Carbon nanotubes are being studied for use in the construction of molecular electronic devices and computers. For example, fabrics that are dipped in an ink of nanotubes and then pressed to thin out the coating are turned into batteries that maintain their flexibility. This creates “wearable electronics” and allows for the possibility of incorporating electronics into flexible surfaces. When applied to a t-shirt, for example, the t-shirt is converted into an “e-shirt.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s04_p06">Silicon is the second must abundant element in Earth’s crust.

Sand is primarily SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, which is used commercially to make glass and prevent caking in food products. Complex compounds of silicon and oxygen with elements such as aluminum are used in detergents and talcum powder and as industrial catalysts. Because silicon-chip technology laid the foundation for the modern electronics industry, the San Jose region of California, where many of the most important advances in electronics and computers were developed, has been nicknamed “Silicon Valley.”</p>

In fact, the term <em class="emphasis">plumbing</em> is derived from <em class="emphasis">plumbum</em>, the Latin name for lead. Lead compounds were used as pigments in paints, and tetraethyllead was an important antiknock agent in gasoline. Now, however, lead has been banned from many uses because of its toxicity, although it is still widely used in lead storage batteries for automobiles. In previous centuries, lead salts were frequently used as medicines. Evidence suggests, for example, that Beethoven’s death was caused by the application of various lead-containing medicines by his physician. Beethoven contracted pneumonia and was treated with lead salts, but in addition, he suffered from a serious liver ailment. His physician treated the ailment by repeatedly puncturing his abdominal cavity and then sealing the wound with a lead-laced poultice. It seems that the repeated doses of lead compounds contributed to Beethoven’s death.</p>

This family has five stable elements; one isotope of bismuth (<sup class="superscript">209</sup>Bi) is nonradioactive and is the heaviest nonradioactive isotope of any element. Once again, the lightest member of the family has unique properties. Although both nitrogen and phosphorus are nonmetals, nitrogen under standard conditions is a diatomic gas (N<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), whereas phosphorus consists of three allotropes: white, a volatile, low-melting solid consisting of P<sub class="subscript">4</sub> tetrahedra; a red solid comprised of P<sub class="subscript">8</sub>, P<sub class="subscript">9</sub>, and P<sub class="subscript">10</sub> cages linked by P<sub class="subscript">2</sub> units; and black layers of corrugated phosphorus sheets.

Once again, the lightest member of the family has unique properties. In its most common pure form, oxygen is a diatomic gas (O<sub class="subscript">2</sub>), whereas sulfur is a volatile solid with S<sub class="subscript">8</sub> rings, selenium and tellurium are gray or silver solids that have chains of atoms, and polonium is a silvery metal with a regular array of atoms.

Oxygen has the second highest electronegativity of any element; its chemistry is dominated by the −2 oxidation state (as in MgO and H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O). No compounds of oxygen in the +4 or +6 oxidation state are known. In contrast, sulfur can form compounds in all three oxidation states. Sulfur accepts electrons from less electronegative elements to give H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>S and Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>S, for example, and it donates electrons to more electronegative elements to give compounds such as SO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, SO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>, and SF<sub class="subscript">6</sub>. Selenium and tellurium, near the diagonal line in the periodic table, behave similarly to sulfur but are somewhat more likely to be found in positive oxidation states.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s06_p03">Oxygen, the second most electronegative element in the periodic table, was not discovered until the late 18th century, even though it constitutes 20% of the atmosphere and is the most abundant element in Earth’s crust. Oxygen is essential for life; our metabolism is based on the oxidation of organic compounds by O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> to produce CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> and H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O. Commercially, oxygen is used in the conversion of pig iron to steel, as the oxidant in oxyacetylene torches for cutting steel, as a fuel for the US space shuttle, and in hospital respirators.</p>

All have filled valence electron configurations and therefore are unreactive elements found in nature as monatomic gases. The noble gases were long referred to as either “rare gases” or “inert gases,” but they are neither rare nor inert. Argon constitutes about 1% of the atmosphere, which also contains small amounts of the lighter group 18 elements, and helium is found in large amounts in many natural gas deposits. The group’s perceived “rarity” stems in part from the fact that the noble gases were the last major family of elements to be discovered.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s08_p02">The noble gases have <em class="emphasis">EA</em> ≥ 0, so they do not form compounds in which they have negative oxidation states. Because ionization energies decrease down the column, the only noble gases that form compounds in which they have positive oxidation states are Kr, Xe, and Rn. Of these three elements, only xenon forms an extensive series of compounds. The chemistry of radon is severely limited by its extreme radioactivity, and the chemistry of krypton is limited by its high ionization energy (1350.8 kJ/mol versus 1170.4 kJ/mol for xenon). In essentially all its compounds, xenon is bonded to highly electronegative atoms such as fluorine or oxygen. In fact, the only significant reaction of xenon is with elemental fluorine, which can give XeF<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, XeF<sub class="subscript">4</sub>, or XeF<sub class="subscript">6</sub>. Oxides such as XeO<sub class="subscript">3</sub> are produced when xenon fluorides react with water, and oxidation with ozone produces the perxenate ion [XeO<sub class="subscript">6</sub><sup class="superscript">4−</sup>], in which xenon acquires a +8 oxidation state by formally donating all eight of its valence electrons to the more electronegative oxygen atoms. In all of its stable compounds, xenon has a positive, even-numbered oxidation state: +2, +4, +6, or +8. The actual stability of these compounds varies greatly. For example, XeO<sub class="subscript">3</sub> is a shock-sensitive, white crystalline solid with explosive power comparable to that of TNT (trinitrotoluene), whereas another compound, Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>XeF<sub class="subscript">8</sub>, is stable up to 300°C.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_s08_p03">Although none of the noble gas compounds is commercially significant, the elements themselves have important applications. For example, argon is used in incandescent light bulbs, where it provides an inert atmosphere that protects the tungsten filament from oxidation, and in compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs). It is also used in arc welding and in the manufacture of reactive elements, such as titanium, or of ultrapure products, such as the silicon used by the electronics industry. Helium, with a boiling point of only 4.2 K, is used as a liquid for studying the properties of substances at very low temperatures. It is also combined in an 80:20 mixture with oxygen used by scuba divers, rather than compressed air, when they descend to great depths. Because helium is less soluble in water than N<sub class="subscript">2</sub>—a component of compressed air—replacing N<sub class="subscript">2</sub> with He prevents the formation of bubbles in blood vessels, a condition called “the bends” that can occur during rapid ascents. Neon is familiar to all of us as the gas responsible for the red glow in neon lights.</p>

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_p17">The chemical families consist of elements that have the same valence electron configuration and tend to have similar chemistry. The alkali metals (group 1) have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup> valence electron configurations and form M<sup class="superscript">+</sup> ions, while the alkaline earth metals (group 2) have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup> valence electron configurations and form M<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ions. Group 13 elements have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">1</sup> valence electron configurations and have an overwhelming tendency to form compounds in the +3 oxidation state. Elements in group 14 have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup> valence electron configurations but exhibit a variety of chemical behaviors because they range from a nonmetal (carbon) to metals (tin/lead). Carbon, the basis of organic compounds, has at least four allotropes with distinct structures: diamond, graphite, <strong class="emphasis bold">fullerenes</strong>, and carbon <strong class="emphasis bold">nanotubes</strong>. The <strong class="emphasis bold">pnicogens</strong> (group 15) all have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">3</sup> valence electron configurations; they form compounds in oxidation states ranging from −3 to +5. The <strong class="emphasis bold">chalcogens</strong> (group 16) have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">4</sup> valence electron configurations and react chemically by either gaining two electrons or by formally losing four or six electrons. The halogens (group 17) all have <em class="emphasis">ns</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup><em class="emphasis">np</em><sup class="superscript">5</sup> valence electron configurations and are diatomic molecules that tend to react chemically by accepting a single electron. The noble gases (group 18) are monatomic gases that are chemically quite unreactive due to the presence of a filled shell of electrons. The <strong class="emphasis bold">transition metals</strong> (groups 3–10) contain partially filled sets of <em class="emphasis">d</em> orbitals, and the <strong class="emphasis bold">lanthanides</strong> and the <strong class="emphasis bold">actinides</strong> are those groups in which <em class="emphasis">f</em> orbitals are being filled. These groups exhibit strong horizontal similarities in behavior. Many of the transition metals form M<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ions, whereas the chemistry of the lanthanides and actinides is dominated by M<sup class="superscript">3+</sup> ions.</p>
