    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_p01">Of the more than 100 known elements, approximately 28 are known to be <strong class="emphasis bold">essential</strong> for the growth of at least one biological species, and only 19 are essential to humans. (For more information on essential elements, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01#averill_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Chemistry"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01_s08#averill_1.0-ch01_s08">Section 1.8 "Essential Elements for Life"</a>, and <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01_s08#averill_1.0-ch01_s08_f01">Figure 1.26 "The Essential Elements in the Periodic Table"</a>.) What makes some elements essential to an organism and the rest nonessential? There are at least two reasons:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_l02">
        <li>The element must have some unique chemical property that an organism can use to its advantage and without which it cannot survive.</li>
        <li>Adequate amounts of the element must be available in the environment in an easily accessible form.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_p02">As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch07_s05_t01">Table 7.6 "Relative Abundance of Some Essential Elements in Earth’s Crust and Oceans"</a>, many of the elements that are abundant in Earth’s crust are nevertheless not found in an easily accessible form (e.g., as ions dissolved in seawater). Instead, they tend to form insoluble oxides, hydroxides, or carbonate salts. Although silicon is the second most abundant element in Earth’s crust, SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> and many silicate minerals are insoluble, so they are not easily absorbed by living tissues. This is also the case for iron and aluminum, which form insoluble hydroxides. Many organisms have therefore developed elaborate strategies to obtain iron from their environment. In contrast, molybdenum and iodine, though not particularly abundant, are highly soluble—molybdenum as molybdate (MoO<sub class="subscript">4</sub><sup class="superscript">2−</sup>) and iodine as iodide (I<sup class="superscript">−</sup>) and iodate (IO<sub class="subscript">3</sub><sup class="superscript">−</sup>)—and thus are more abundant in seawater than iron. Not surprisingly, both molybdenum and iodine are used by many organisms.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_s01_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">macrominerals</a><span class="glossdef">Any of the six essential elements (Na, Mg, K, Ca, Cl, and P) that provide essential ions in body fluids and form the major structural components of the body.</span></span>—Na, Mg, K, Ca, Cl, and P—are found in large amounts in biological tissues and are present as inorganic compounds, either dissolved or precipitated. All form monatomic ions (Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup>, Mg<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>, K<sup class="superscript">+</sup>, Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>, Cl<sup class="superscript">−</sup>) except for phosphorus, which is found as the phosphate ion (PO<sub class="subscript">4</sub><sup class="superscript">3−</sup>). Recall that calcium salts are used by many organisms as structural materials, such as in bone [hydroxyapatite, Ca<sub class="subscript">5</sub>(PO<sub class="subscript">4</sub>)<sub class="subscript">3</sub>OH]; calcium salts are also in sea shells and egg shells (CaCO<sub class="subscript">3</sub>), and they serve as a repository for Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> in plants (calcium oxalate).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_s01_p02">The body fluids of all multicellular organisms contain relatively high concentrations of these ions. Some ions (Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup>, Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>, and Cl<sup class="superscript">−</sup>) are located primarily in <em class="emphasis">extracellular</em> fluids such as blood plasma, whereas K<sup class="superscript">+</sup>, Mg<sup class="superscript">2+</sup>, and phosphate are located primarily in <em class="emphasis">intracellular</em> fluids. Substantial amounts of energy are required to selectively transport these ions across cell membranes. The selectivity of these <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ion pumps</a><span class="glossdef">A complex assembly of proteins that selectively transports ions across cell membranes toward the side with the higher concentration.</span></span> is based on differences in ionic radius (<a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch07_s02#averill_1.0-ch07_s02">Section 7.2 "Sizes of Atoms and Ions"</a>) and ionic charge.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_s01_p03">Maintaining optimum levels of macrominerals is important because temporary changes in their concentration within a cell affect biological functions. For example, nerve impulse transmission requires a sudden, reversible increase in the amount of Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup> that flows into the nerve cell. Similarly, when hormones bind to a cell, they can cause Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ions to enter that cell. In a complex series of reactions, the Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> ions trigger events such as muscle contraction, the release of neurotransmitters, or the secretion of hormones. When people who exercise vigorously for long periods of time overhydrate with water, low blood salt levels can result in a condition known as <em class="emphasis">hyponatremia</em>, which causes nausea, fatigue, weakness, seizures, and even death. For this reason, athletes should hydrate with a sports drink containing salts, not just water.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_s03_p01">A third important role of trace elements is to transfer electrons in biological oxidation–reduction reactions. Iron and copper, for example, are found in proteins and enzymes that participate in O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> transport, the reduction of O<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, the oxidation of organic molecules, and the conversion of atmospheric N<sub class="subscript">2</sub> to NH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>. These metals usually transfer one electron per metal ion by alternating between oxidation states, such as 3+/2+ (Fe) or 2+/1+ (Cu).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_s03_p02">Because most transition metals have multiple oxidation states separated by only one electron, they are uniquely suited to transfer multiple electrons one at a time. Examples include molybdenum (+6/+5/+4), which is widely used for two-electron oxidation–reduction reactions, and cobalt (+3/+2/+1), which is found in vitamin B<sub class="subscript">12</sub>. In contrast, many of the <em class="emphasis">p</em>-block elements are well suited for transferring <em class="emphasis">two</em> electrons at once. Selenium (+4/+2), for example, is found in the enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of glutathione (GSH) to its disulfide form (GSSG): 2 GSH + H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O<sub class="subscript">2</sub> → 2 H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O + GSSG. (For more information about glutathione and its disulfide form, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch04#averill_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "Reactions in Aqueous Solution"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch04_s09#averill_1.0-ch04_s09">Section 4.9 "Quantitative Analysis Using Titrations"</a>, Example 20.)</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Structural Components</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch07_s05_s04_p01">Trace elements also act as essential structural components of biological tissues or molecules. In many systems where trace elements do not change oxidation states or otherwise participate directly in biochemical reactions, it is often assumed, though frequently with no direct evidence, that the element stabilizes a particular three-dimensional structure of the biomolecule in which it is found. One example is a sugar-binding protein containing Mn<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> and Ca<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> that is a part of the biological defense system of certain plants. Other examples include enzymes that require Zn<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> at one site for activity to occur at a different site on the molecule. Some nonmetallic elements, such as F<sup class="superscript">−</sup>, also appear to have structural roles. Fluoride, for example, displaces the hydroxide ion from hydroxyapatite in bone and teeth to form fluoroapatite [Ca<sub class="subscript">5</sub>(PO<sub class="subscript">4</sub>)<sub class="subscript">3</sub>F]. Fluoroapatite is less soluble in acid and provides increased resistance to tooth decay. Another example of a nonmetal that plays a structural role is iodine, which in humans is found in only one molecule, the thyroid hormone <em class="emphasis">thyroxine</em>. When a person’s diet does not contain sufficient iodine, the thyroid glands in their neck become greatly enlarged, leading to a condition called <em class="emphasis">goiter</em>. Because iodine is found primarily in ocean fish and seaweed, many of the original settlers of the American Midwest developed goiter due to the lack of seafood in their diet. Today most table salt contains small amounts of iodine [actually potassium iodide (KI)] to prevent this problem.</p>
