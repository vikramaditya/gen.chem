    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s03_p01">Very few of the transition metals are found in nature as free metals. Consequently, almost all metallic elements must be isolated from metal oxide or metal sulfide ores. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Metallurgy</a><span class="glossdef">A set of processes by which metals are extracted from their ores and converted to more useful forms.</span></span> is the set of processes by which metals are extracted from their ores and converted to more useful forms.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s03_p02">Metallurgy consists of three general steps: (1) mining the ore, (2) separating and concentrating the metal or the metal-containing compound, and (3) reducing the ore to the metal. Additional processes are sometimes required to improve the mechanical properties of the metal or increase its purity. Many ores contain relatively low concentrations of the desired metal; for example, copper ores that contain even 1% Cu by mass are considered commercially useful.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s03_p03">After an ore has been mined, the first step in processing is usually to crush it because the rate of chemical reactions increases dramatically with increased surface area. Next, one of three general strategies is used to separate and concentrate the compound(s) of interest: <em class="emphasis">settling</em> and <em class="emphasis">flotation</em>, which are based on differences in density between the desired compound and impurities; <em class="emphasis">pyrometallurgy</em>, which uses chemical reduction at high temperatures; and <em class="emphasis">hydrometallurgy</em>, which employs chemical or electrochemical reduction of an aqueous solution of the metal. Other methods that take advantage of unusual physical or chemical properties of a particular compound may also be used. For example, crystals of magnetite (Fe<sub class="subscript">3</sub>O<sub class="subscript">4</sub>) are tiny but rather powerful magnets; in fact, magnetite (also known as <em class="emphasis">lodestone</em>) was used to make the first compasses in China during the first century BC. If a crushed ore that contains magnetite is passed through a powerful magnet, the Fe<sub class="subscript">3</sub>O<sub class="subscript">4</sub> particles are attracted to the poles of the magnet, allowing them to be easily separated from other minerals.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Note the Pattern</h3>
        <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s03_p04">Metallurgy depends on the separation of a metal compound from its ore and reduction to the metal at high temperature (pyrometallurgy) or in aqueous solution (hydrometallurgy).</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch23_s03_p05">Settling and flotation have been used for thousands of years to separate particles of dense metals such as gold, using the technique known as <em class="emphasis">panning</em>, in which a sample of gravel or sand is swirled in water in a shallow metal pan. Because the density of gold (19.3 g/cm<sup class="superscript">3</sup>) is so much greater than that of most silicate minerals (about 2.5 g/cm<sup class="superscript">3</sup>), silicate particles settle more slowly and can be poured off with the water, leaving dense gold particles on the bottom of the pan. Conversely, in flotation, the compound of interest is made to float on top of a solution. Blowing air through a suspension of the crude ore in a mixture of water and an organic liquid, such as pine tar, produces a “froth” that contains tiny particles of hydrophobic solids, such as metal sulfides, while more hydrophilic oxide minerals remain suspended in the aqueous phase (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch23_s03_f01">Figure 23.6 "Froth Flotation"</a>). To make the separation more efficient, small amounts of an anionic sulfur-containing compound, such as Na<sup class="superscript">+</sup>C<sub class="subscript">2</sub>H<sub class="subscript">5</sub>OCS<sub class="subscript">2</sub><sup class="superscript">−</sup>, are added; the additive binds to the sulfur-rich surface of the metal sulfide particles and makes the metal sulfide particles even more hydrophobic. The resulting froth is highly enriched in the desired metal sulfide(s), which can be removed simply by skimming. This method works even for compounds as dense as PbS (7.5 g/cm<sup class="superscript">3</sup>).</p>

(b) A froth containing precious metal sulfides is formed as a by-product during the production of metallic nickel. (c) An anionic sulfur additive with hydrophobic “tails” can be used to enhance the hydrophobic character of metal sulfide particles, which causes them to be attracted to the air/water interface in the foam.</p>

Then, because most metal sulfides cannot be reduced directly to the metal using carbon, you will probably need to convert WS<sub class="subscript">2</sub> to an oxide for subsequent reduction.

In pyrometallurgy, a reductant must be used that does not form stable compounds with the metal of interest. In hydrometallurgy, metals are separated via the formation of metal complexes.</p>
