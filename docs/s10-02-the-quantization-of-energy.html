    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch06_s02_p01">By the late 19th century, many physicists thought their discipline was well on the way to explaining most natural phenomena. They could calculate the motions of material objects using Newton’s laws of classical mechanics, and they could describe the properties of radiant energy using mathematical relationships known as Maxwell’s equations, developed in 1873 by James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physicist. The universe appeared to be a simple and orderly place, containing matter, which consisted of particles that had mass and whose location and motion could be accurately described, and electromagnetic radiation, which was viewed as having no mass and whose exact position in space could not be fixed. Thus matter and energy were considered distinct and unrelated phenomena. Soon, however, scientists began to look more closely at a few inconvenient phenomena that could <em class="emphasis">not</em> be explained by the theories available at the time.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p01">One phenomenon that seemed to contradict the theories of classical physics was <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">blackbody radiation</a><span class="glossdef">Electromagnetic radiation whose wavelength and color depends on the temperature of the object.</span></span>, the energy emitted by an object when it is heated. The wavelength of energy emitted by an object depends on only its temperature, not its surface or composition. Hence an electric stove burner or the filament of a space heater glows dull red or orange when heated, whereas the much hotter tungsten wire in an incandescent light bulb gives off a yellowish light (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_f01">Figure 6.5 "Blackbody Radiation"</a>).</p>

            <p class="para">When heated, all objects emit electromagnetic radiation whose wavelength (and color) depends on the temperature of the object. A relatively low-temperature object, such as an electric stove element, on a low setting appears red, whereas a higher-temperature object, such as the filament of an incandescent light bulb, appears yellow or white.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p02">The <em class="emphasis">intensity</em> of radiation is a measure of the energy emitted per unit area. A plot of the intensity of blackbody radiation as a function of wavelength for an object at various temperatures is shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_f02">Figure 6.6 "Relationship between the Temperature of an Object and the Spectrum of Blackbody Radiation It Emits"</a>. One of the major assumptions of classical physics was that energy increased or decreased in a smooth, continuous manner. For example, classical physics predicted that as wavelength decreased, the intensity of the radiation an object emits should increase in a smooth curve without limit at <em class="emphasis">all</em> temperatures, as shown by the broken line for 6000 K in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_f02">Figure 6.6 "Relationship between the Temperature of an Object and the Spectrum of Blackbody Radiation It Emits"</a>. Thus classical physics could not explain the sharp <em class="emphasis">decrease</em> in the intensity of radiation emitted at shorter wavelengths (primarily in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum), which we now refer to as the “ultraviolet catastrophe.” In 1900, however, the German physicist Max Planck (1858–1947) explained the ultraviolet catastrophe by proposing that the energy of electromagnetic waves is <em class="emphasis">quantized</em> rather than continuous. This means that for each temperature, there is a maximum intensity of radiation that is emitted in a blackbody object, corresponding to the peaks in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_f02">Figure 6.6 "Relationship between the Temperature of an Object and the Spectrum of Blackbody Radiation It Emits"</a>, so the intensity does not follow a smooth curve as the temperature increases, as predicted by classical physics.

            <p class="para">At relatively low temperatures, most radiation is emitted at wavelengths longer than 700 nm, which is in the infrared portion of the spectrum. The dull red glow of the electric stove element in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_f01">Figure 6.5 "Blackbody Radiation"</a> is due to the small amount of radiation emitted at wavelengths less than 700 nm, which the eye can detect. As the temperature of the object increases, the maximum intensity shifts to shorter wavelengths, successively resulting in orange, yellow, and finally white light. At high temperatures, all wavelengths of visible light are emitted with approximately equal intensities. The white light spectrum shown for an object at 6000 K closely approximates the spectrum of light emitted by the sun (<a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch06_s03#averill_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_f01">Figure 6.14 "The Visible Spectrum of Sunlight"</a>). Note the sharp decrease in the intensity of radiation emitted at wavelengths below 400 nm, which constituted the ultraviolet catastrophe. The classical prediction fails to fit the experimental curves entirely and does not have a maximum intensity.</p>

During the 1930s, Planck felt it was his duty to remain in Germany, despite his open opposition to the policies of the Nazi government.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p04">Although quantization may seem to be an unfamiliar concept, we encounter it frequently. For example, US money is integral multiples of pennies. Similarly, musical instruments like a piano or a trumpet can produce only certain musical notes, such as C or F sharp. Because these instruments cannot produce a continuous range of frequencies, their frequencies are quantized. Even electrical charge is quantized: an ion may have a charge of −1 or −2 but <em class="emphasis">not</em> −1.33.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p07">As the frequency of electromagnetic radiation increases, the magnitude of the associated quantum of radiant energy increases. By assuming that energy can be emitted by an object only in integral multiples of <em class="emphasis">h</em>ν, Planck devised an equation that fit the experimental data shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_f02">Figure 6.6 "Relationship between the Temperature of an Object and the Spectrum of Blackbody Radiation It Emits"</a>. We can understand Planck’s explanation of the ultraviolet catastrophe qualitatively as follows: At low temperatures, radiation with only relatively low frequencies is emitted, corresponding to low-energy quanta. As the temperature of an object increases, there is an increased probability of emitting radiation with higher frequencies, corresponding to higher-energy quanta. At any temperature, however, it is simply more probable for an object to lose energy by emitting <em class="emphasis">n</em> lower-energy quanta than a single very high-energy quantum that corresponds to ultraviolet radiation. The result is a maximum in the plot of intensity of emitted radiation versus wavelength, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_f02">Figure 6.6 "Relationship between the Temperature of an Object and the Spectrum of Blackbody Radiation It Emits"</a>, and a shift in the position of the maximum to lower wavelength (higher frequency) with increasing temperature.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p08">At the time he proposed his radical hypothesis, Planck could not explain <em class="emphasis">why</em> energies should be quantized. Initially, his hypothesis explained only one set of experimental data—blackbody radiation. If quantization were observed for a large number of different phenomena, then quantization would become a law (as defined in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch01#averill_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction to Chemistry"</a>). In time, a theory might be developed to explain that law. As things turned out, Planck’s hypothesis was the seed from which modern physics grew.</p>

When certain metals are exposed to light, electrons are ejected from their surface (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_f01">Figure 6.7 "The Photoelectric Effect"</a>). Classical physics predicted that the number of electrons emitted and their kinetic energy should depend on only the intensity of the light, <em class="emphasis">not</em> its frequency. In fact, however, each metal was found to have a characteristic threshold frequency of light; below that frequency, <em class="emphasis">no</em> electrons are emitted regardless of the light’s intensity. Above the threshold frequency, the number of electrons emitted was found to be proportional to the intensity of the light, and their kinetic energy was proportional to the frequency.

He was born in Germany and throughout his childhood his parents and teachers had worried that he might be developmentally disabled. The patent office job was a low-level civil service position that was not very demanding, but it did allow Einstein to spend a great deal of time reading and thinking about physics. In 1905, he published his paper on the photoelectric effect, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1921.</p>

Both theories are based on the existence of simple building blocks, atoms in one case and quanta of energy in the other. The work of Planck and Einstein thus suggested a connection between the quantized nature of energy and the properties of individual atoms. In fact, Einstein’s Nobel Prize was awarded for his work on the photoelectric effect (<em class="emphasis">not</em> for his more famous equation <em class="emphasis">E</em> = <em class="emphasis">mc</em><sup class="superscript">2</sup>), demonstrating its fundamental importance.</p>

Preliminary research indicates that odorant molecules absorb a quantum of energy that causes their bonds to vibrate at a specific frequency. Because different assemblages of molecules have different characteristic frequencies, these vibrations seem to act as a molecular signature that can be detected as an odor. Studies with flies show that they can distinguish between similar molecules with different vibrational frequencies. This vibrational theory of smell could serve as a discriminatory process in nature in other ways and is an active area of research.</p>

The energy of a quantum is proportional to the frequency of the radiation; the proportionality constant <em class="emphasis">h</em> is a fundamental constant (Planck’s constant). Albert Einstein used Planck’s concept of the quantization of energy to explain the <strong class="emphasis bold">photoelectric effect</strong>, the ejection of electrons from certain metals when exposed to light. Einstein postulated the existence of what today we call <strong class="emphasis bold">photons</strong>, particles of light with a particular energy, <em class="emphasis">E</em> = <em class="emphasis">h</em>ν.
