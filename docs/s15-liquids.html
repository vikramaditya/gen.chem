    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_p01">In <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch10#averill_1.0-ch10">Chapter 10 "Gases"</a>, you learned that attractive intermolecular forces cause most gases to condense to liquids at high pressure, low temperature, or both. Substances that normally are liquids are held together by exactly the same forces that are responsible for the liquefaction of gases. One such substance is water, the solvent in which all biochemical reactions take place. Because of its thermal properties, water also modulates Earth’s temperature, maintaining a temperature range suitable for life. Other liquids are used to manufacture objects that we use every day—for example, a solid material is converted to a liquid, the liquid is injected into a mold, and it is then solidified into complex shapes under conditions that are carefully controlled. To understand such processes, our study of the macroscopic properties of matter must include an understanding of the properties of liquids and the interconversion of the three states of matter: gases, liquids, and solids.</p>

By the end of the chapter, you will understand what is happening at the molecular level when you dry yourself with a towel, why you feel cold when you come out of the water, why ice is slippery, and how it is possible to decaffeinate coffee without removing important flavor components. You will also learn how liquid crystal display (LCD) devices in electronic devices function, and how adhesive strips used to measure body temperature change color to indicate a fever.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">11.1</span> The Kinetic Molecular Description of Liquids</h2>

            <li>To be familiar with the kinetic molecular description of liquids.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_p01">The kinetic molecular theory of gases described in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch10#averill_1.0-ch10">Chapter 10 "Gases"</a> gives a reasonably accurate description of the behavior of gases. A similar model can be applied to liquids, but it must take into account the nonzero volumes of particles and the presence of strong intermolecular attractive forces.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_p02">In a gas, the distance between molecules, whether monatomic or polyatomic, is very large compared with the size of the molecules; thus gases have a low density and are highly compressible. In contrast, the molecules in liquids are very close together, with essentially no empty space between them. As in gases, however, the molecules in liquids are in constant motion, and their kinetic energy (and hence their speed) depends on their temperature. We begin our discussion by examining some of the characteristic properties of liquids to see how each is consistent with a modified kinetic molecular description.</p>
    <div class="section" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Density</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p01">The molecules of a liquid are packed relatively close together. Consequently, liquids are much denser than gases. The density of a liquid is typically about the same as the density of the solid state of the substance. Densities of liquids are therefore more commonly measured in units of grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm<sup class="superscript">3</sup>) or grams per milliliter (g/mL) than in grams per liter (g/L), the unit commonly used for gases.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Molecular Order</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_p01">Liquids exhibit short-range order because strong intermolecular attractive forces cause the molecules to pack together rather tightly. Because of their higher kinetic energy compared to the molecules in a solid, however, the molecules in a liquid move rapidly with respect to one another. Thus unlike the ions in the ionic solids discussed in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch08#averill_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Ionic versus Covalent Bonding"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch08_s02#averill_1.0-ch08_s02">Section 8.2 "Ionic Bonding"</a>, the molecules in liquids are not arranged in a repeating three-dimensional array. Unlike the molecules in gases, however, the arrangement of the molecules in a liquid is not completely random.</p>

    <div class="section" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Compressibility</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_p01">Liquids have so little empty space between their component molecules that they cannot be readily compressed. Compression would force the atoms on adjacent molecules to occupy the same region of space.</p>

    <div class="section" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Thermal Expansion</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s04_p01">The intermolecular forces in liquids are strong enough to keep them from expanding significantly when heated (typically only a few percent over a 100°C temperature range). Thus the volumes of liquids are somewhat fixed. Notice from <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s04_t01">Table 11.1 "The Density of Water at Various Temperatures"</a> that the density of water, for example, changes by only about 3% over a 90-degree temperature range.</p>

In contrast to <em class="emphasis">intra</em>molecular forces, such as the covalent bonds that hold atoms together in molecules and polyatomic ions, <em class="emphasis">inter</em>molecular forces hold molecules together in a liquid or solid. Intermolecular forces are generally much weaker than covalent bonds. For example, it requires 927 kJ to overcome the intramolecular forces and break both O–H bonds in 1 mol of water, but it takes only about 41 kJ to overcome the intermolecular attractions and convert 1 mol of liquid water to water vapor at 100°C. (Despite this seemingly low value, the intermolecular forces in liquid water are among the strongest such forces known!)

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s02_p03">Intermolecular forces determine bulk properties such as the melting points of solids and the boiling points of liquids. Liquids boil when the molecules have enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular attractive forces that hold them together, thereby forming bubbles of vapor within the liquid. Similarly, solids melt when the molecules acquire enough thermal energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that lock them into place in the solid.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s02_p04">Intermolecular forces are electrostatic in nature; that is, they arise from the interaction between positively and negatively charged species. Like covalent and ionic bonds, intermolecular interactions are the sum of both attractive and repulsive components. Because electrostatic interactions fall off rapidly with increasing distance between molecules, intermolecular interactions are most important for solids and liquids, where the molecules are close together. These interactions become important for gases only at very high pressures, where they are responsible for the observed deviations from the ideal gas law at high pressures. (For more information on the behavior of real gases and deviations from the ideal gas law, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch10#averill_1.0-ch10">Chapter 10 "Gases"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch10_s08#averill_1.0-ch10_s08">Section 10.8 "The Behavior of Real Gases"</a>.)</p>

In addition, the attractive interaction between dipoles falls off much more rapidly with increasing distance than do the ion–ion interactions we considered in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch08#averill_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Ionic versus Covalent Bonding"</a>. Recall that the attractive energy between two ions is proportional to 1/<em class="emphasis">r</em>, where <em class="emphasis">r</em> is the distance between the ions. Doubling the distance (<em class="emphasis">r</em> → 2<em class="emphasis">r</em>) decreases the attractive energy by one-half. In contrast, the energy of the interaction of two dipoles is proportional to 1/<em class="emphasis">r</em><sup class="superscript">6</sup>, so doubling the distance between the dipoles decreases the strength of the interaction by 2<sup class="superscript">6</sup>, or 64-fold. Thus a substance such as HCl, which is partially held together by dipole–dipole interactions, is a gas at room temperature and 1 atm pressure, whereas NaCl, which is held together by interionic interactions, is a high-melting-point solid. Within a series of compounds of similar molar mass, the strength of the intermolecular interactions increases as the dipole moment of the molecules increases, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_t01">Table 11.2 "Relationships between the Dipole Moment and the Boiling Point for Organic Compounds of Similar Molar Mass"</a>. Using what we learned in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch09#averill_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Molecular Geometry and Covalent Bonding Models"</a> about predicting relative bond polarities from the electronegativities of the bonded atoms, we can make educated guesses about the relative boiling points of similar molecules.</p>

The first compound, 2-methylpropane, contains only C–H bonds, which are not very polar because C and H have similar electronegativities. It should therefore have a very small (but nonzero) dipole moment and a very low boiling point. Ethyl methyl ether has a structure similar to H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O; it contains two polar C–O single bonds oriented at about a 109° angle to each other, in addition to relatively nonpolar C–H bonds. As a result, the C–O bond dipoles partially reinforce one another and generate a significant dipole moment that should give a moderately high boiling point. Acetone contains a polar C=O double bond oriented at about 120° to two methyl groups with nonpolar C–H bonds. The C–O bond dipole therefore corresponds to the molecular dipole, which should result in both a rather large dipole moment and a high boiling point. Thus we predict the following order of boiling points: 2-methylpropane &lt; ethyl methyl ether &lt; acetone. This result is in good agreement with the actual data: 2-methylpropane, boiling point = −11.7°C, and the dipole moment (μ) = 0.13 D; methyl ethyl ether, boiling point = 7.4°C and μ = 1.17 D; acetone, boiling point = 56.1°C and μ = 2.88 D.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_p03">Consider a pair of adjacent He atoms, for example. On average, the two electrons in each He atom are uniformly distributed around the nucleus. Because the electrons are in constant motion, however, their distribution in one atom is likely to be asymmetrical at any given instant, resulting in an instantaneous dipole moment. As shown in part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s02_f01">Figure 11.5 "Instantaneous Dipole Moments"</a>, the instantaneous dipole moment on one atom can interact with the electrons in an adjacent atom, pulling them toward the positive end of the instantaneous dipole or repelling them from the negative end.

For example, Xe boils at −108.1°C, whereas He boils at −269°C. The reason for this trend is that the strength of London dispersion forces is related to the ease with which the electron distribution in a given atom can be perturbed. In small atoms such as He, the two 1<em class="emphasis">s</em> electrons are held close to the nucleus in a very small volume, and electron–electron repulsions are strong enough to prevent significant asymmetry in their distribution. In larger atoms such as Xe, however, the outer electrons are much less strongly attracted to the nucleus because of filled intervening shells. (For more information on shielding, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch07#averill_1.0-ch07">Chapter 7 "The Periodic Table and Periodic Trends"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch07_s02#averill_1.0-ch07_s02">Section 7.2 "Sizes of Atoms and Ions"</a>.) As a result, it is relatively easy to temporarily deform the electron distribution to generate an instantaneous or induced dipole. The ease of deformation of the electron distribution in an atom or molecule is called its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">polarizability</a><span class="glossdef">The ease of deformation of the electron distribution in an atom or molecule.</span></span>. Because the electron distribution is more easily perturbed in large, heavy species than in small, light species, we say that heavier substances tend to be much more <em class="emphasis">polarizable</em> than lighter ones.</p>

These result in much higher boiling points than are observed for substances in which London dispersion forces dominate, as illustrated for the covalent hydrides of elements of groups 14–17 in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_f01">Figure 11.7 "The Effects of Hydrogen Bonding on Boiling Points"</a>. Methane and its heavier congeners in group 14 form a series whose boiling points increase smoothly with increasing molar mass. This is the expected trend in nonpolar molecules, for which London dispersion forces are the exclusive intermolecular forces. In contrast, the hydrides of the lightest members of groups 15–17 have boiling points that are more than 100°C greater than predicted on the basis of their molar masses. The effect is most dramatic for water: if we extend the straight line connecting the points for H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Te and H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Se to the line for period 2, we obtain an estimated boiling point of −130°C for water!

        <p class="para block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_p02">Why do strong intermolecular forces produce such anomalously high boiling points and other unusual properties, such as high enthalpies of vaporization and high melting points? The answer lies in the highly polar nature of the bonds between hydrogen and very electronegative elements such as O, N, and F. The large difference in electronegativity results in a large partial positive charge on hydrogen and a correspondingly large partial negative charge on the O, N, or F atom. Consequently, H–O, H–N, and H–F bonds have very large bond dipoles that can interact strongly with one another. Because a hydrogen atom is so small, these dipoles can also approach one another more closely than most other dipoles. The combination of large bond dipoles and short dipole–dipole distances results in very strong dipole–dipole interactions called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hydrogen bonds</a><span class="glossdef">An unusually strong dipole-dipole interaction (intermolecular force) that results when hydrogen is bonded to very electronegative elements, such as O, N, and F.</span></span>, as shown for ice in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s02_s03_f02">Figure 11.8 "The Hydrogen-Bonded Structure of Ice"</a>. A hydrogen bond is usually indicated by a dotted line between the hydrogen atom attached to O, N, or F (the <em class="emphasis">hydrogen bond donor</em>) and the atom that has the lone pair of electrons (the <em class="emphasis">hydrogen bond acceptor</em>). Because each water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms and two lone pairs, a tetrahedral arrangement maximizes the number of hydrogen bonds that can be formed. In the structure of ice, each oxygen atom is surrounded by a distorted tetrahedron of hydrogen atoms that form bridges to the oxygen atoms of adjacent water molecules. The bridging hydrogen atoms are <em class="emphasis">not</em> equidistant from the two oxygen atoms they connect, however. Instead, each hydrogen atom is 101 pm from one oxygen and 174 pm from the other. In contrast, each oxygen atom is bonded to two H atoms at the shorter distance and two at the longer distance, corresponding to two O–H covalent bonds and two <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="averill_1.0-ch11_m001" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mtext>O</mtext><mo>⋅</mo><mo>⋅</mo><mo>⋅</mo><mtext>H</mtext></mrow></semantics></math></span> hydrogen bonds from adjacent water molecules, respectively.

Although methanol also has two lone pairs of electrons on oxygen that can act as hydrogen bond acceptors, it only has one O–H bond with an H atom that can act as a hydrogen bond donor.

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s03_p01">Although you have been introduced to some of the interactions that hold molecules together in a liquid, we have not yet discussed the consequences of those interactions for the bulk properties of liquids. We now turn our attention to three unique properties of liquids that intimately depend on the nature of intermolecular interactions: surface tension, capillary action, and viscosity.</p>
    <div class="section" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Surface Tension</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p01">We stated in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch11_s01#averill_1.0-ch11_s01">Section 11.1 "The Kinetic Molecular Description of Liquids"</a> that liquids tend to adopt the shapes of their containers. Why, then, do small amounts of water on a freshly waxed car form raised droplets instead of a thin, continuous film? The answer lies in a property called <em class="emphasis">surface tension</em>, which depends on intermolecular forces.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p02"><a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_f01">Figure 11.9 "A Representation of Surface Tension in a Liquid"</a> presents a microscopic view of a liquid droplet. A typical molecule in the <em class="emphasis">interior</em> of the droplet is surrounded by other molecules that exert attractive forces from all directions. Consequently, there is no <em class="emphasis">net</em> force on the molecule that would cause it to move in a particular direction. In contrast, a molecule on the <em class="emphasis">surface</em> experiences a net attraction toward the drop because there are no molecules on the outside to balance the forces exerted by adjacent molecules in the interior. Because a sphere has the smallest possible surface area for a given volume, intermolecular attractive interactions between water molecules cause the droplet to adopt a spherical shape. This maximizes the number of attractive interactions and minimizes the number of water molecules at the surface. Hence raindrops are almost spherical, and drops of water on a waxed (nonpolar) surface, which does not interact strongly with water, form round beads (see the chapter opener photo). A dirty car is covered with a mixture of substances, some of which are polar. Attractive interactions between the polar substances and water cause the water to spread out into a thin film instead of forming beads.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p03">The same phenomenon holds molecules together at the surface of a bulk sample of water, almost as if they formed a skin. When filling a glass with water, the glass can be overfilled so that the level of the liquid actually extends <em class="emphasis">above</em> the rim. Similarly, a sewing needle or a paper clip can be placed on the surface of a glass of water where it “floats,” even though steel is much denser than water (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_f02">Figure 11.10 "The Effects of the High Surface Tension of Liquid Water"</a>). Many insects take advantage of this property to walk on the surface of puddles or ponds without sinking (part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_f02">Figure 11.10 "The Effects of the High Surface Tension of Liquid Water"</a>).</p>

Surface tension is measured in units of energy per area (e.g., <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="averill_1.0-ch11_m004" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mtext>J</mtext><mo>/</mo><msup><mtext>m</mtext><mtext>2</mtext></msup></mrow></semantics></math></span>).</span></span>, which is defined as the energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid by a specific amount. Surface tension is therefore measured as energy per unit area, such as joules per square meter (J/m<sup class="superscript">2</sup>) or dyne per centimeter (dyn/cm), where 1 dyn = 1 × 10<sup class="superscript">−5</sup> N. The values of the surface tension of some representative liquids are listed in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_t01">Table 11.4 "Surface Tension, Viscosity, Vapor Pressure (at 25°C Unless Otherwise Indicated), and Normal Boiling Points of Common Liquids"</a>. Note the correlation between the surface tension of a liquid and the strength of the intermolecular forces: the stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher the surface tension. For example, water, with its strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, has one of the highest surface tension values of any liquid, whereas low-boiling-point organic molecules, which have relatively weak intermolecular forces, have much lower surface tensions. Mercury is an apparent anomaly, but its very high surface tension is due to the presence of strong metallic bonding, which we will discuss in more detail in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12#averill_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Solids"</a>.</p>

In the 1960s, US Navy researchers developed a method of fighting fires aboard aircraft carriers using “foams,” which are aqueous solutions of fluorinated surfactants. The surfactants reduce the surface tension of water below that of fuel, so the fluorinated solution is able to spread across the burning surface and extinguish the fire. Such foams are now used universally to fight large-scale fires of organic liquids.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p02">Capillary action is the net result of two opposing sets of forces: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cohesive forces</a><span class="glossdef">The intermolecular forces that hold a liquid together.</span></span>, which are the intermolecular forces that hold a liquid together, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">adhesive forces</a><span class="glossdef">The attractive intermolecular forces between a liquid and the substance comprising the surface of a capillary.</span></span>, which are the attractive forces between a liquid and the substance that composes the capillary. Water has both strong adhesion to glass, which contains polar SiOH groups, and strong intermolecular cohesion. When a glass capillary is put into water, the surface tension due to cohesive forces constricts the surface area of water within the tube, while adhesion between the water and the glass creates an upward force that maximizes the amount of glass surface in contact with the water. If the adhesive forces are stronger than the cohesive forces, as is the case for water, then the liquid in the capillary rises to the level where the downward force of gravity exactly balances this upward force. If, however, the cohesive forces are stronger than the adhesive forces, as is the case for mercury and glass, the liquid pulls itself down into the capillary below the surface of the bulk liquid to minimize contact with the glass (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_f02">Figure 11.12 "The Effects of Capillary Action"</a>). The upper surface of a liquid in a tube is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">meniscus</a><span class="glossdef">The upper surface of the liquid in a tube.</span></span>, and the shape of the meniscus depends on the relative strengths of the cohesive and adhesive forces.

Plants contain tiny rigid tubes composed of cellulose, to which water has strong adhesion. Because of the strong adhesive forces, nutrients can be transported from the roots to the tops of trees that are more than 50 m tall. Cotton towels are also made of cellulose; they absorb water because the tiny tubes act like capillaries and “wick” the water away from your skin.

Some liquids, such as gasoline, ethanol, and water, flow very readily and hence have a <em class="emphasis">low viscosity</em>. Others, such as motor oil, molasses, and maple syrup, flow very slowly and have a <em class="emphasis">high viscosity</em>. The two most common methods for evaluating the viscosity of a liquid are (1) to measure the time it takes for a quantity of liquid to flow through a narrow vertical tube and (2) to measure the time it takes steel balls to fall through a given volume of the liquid. The higher the viscosity, the slower the liquid flows through the tube and the steel balls fall. Viscosity is expressed in units of the poise (mPa·s); the higher the number, the higher the viscosity. The viscosities of some representative liquids are listed in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_t01">Table 11.4 "Surface Tension, Viscosity, Vapor Pressure (at 25°C Unless Otherwise Indicated), and Normal Boiling Points of Common Liquids"</a> and show a correlation between viscosity and intermolecular forces. Because a liquid can flow only if the molecules can move past one another with minimal resistance, strong intermolecular attractive forces make it more difficult for molecules to move with respect to one another. The addition of a second hydroxyl group to ethanol, for example, which produces ethylene glycol (HOCH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>CH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>OH), increases the viscosity 15-fold. This effect is due to the increased number of hydrogen bonds that can form between hydroxyl groups in adjacent molecules, resulting in dramatically stronger intermolecular attractive forces.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s03_p02">There is also a correlation between viscosity and molecular shape. Liquids consisting of long, flexible molecules tend to have higher viscosities than those composed of more spherical or shorter-chain molecules. The longer the molecules, the easier it is for them to become “tangled” with one another, making it more difficult for them to move past one another. London dispersion forces also increase with chain length. Due to a combination of these two effects, long-chain hydrocarbons (such as motor oils) are highly viscous.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s03_p04">Motor oils and other lubricants demonstrate the practical importance of controlling viscosity. The oil in an automobile engine must effectively lubricate under a wide range of conditions, from subzero starting temperatures to the 200°C that oil can reach in an engine in the heat of the Mojave Desert in August. Viscosity decreases rapidly with increasing temperatures because the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, and higher kinetic energy enables the molecules to overcome the attractive forces that prevent the liquid from flowing. As a result, an oil that is thin enough to be a good lubricant in a cold engine will become too “thin” (have too low a viscosity) to be effective at high temperatures. The viscosity of motor oils is described by an SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) rating ranging from SAE 5 to SAE 50 for engine oils: the lower the number, the lower the viscosity. So-called <em class="emphasis">single-grade oils</em> can cause major problems. If they are viscous enough to work at high operating temperatures (SAE 50, for example), then at low temperatures, they can be so viscous that a car is difficult to start or an engine is not properly lubricated. Consequently, most modern oils are <em class="emphasis">multigrade</em>, with designations such as SAE 20W/50 (a grade used in high-performance sports cars), in which case the oil has the viscosity of an SAE 20 oil at subzero temperatures (hence the W for winter) and the viscosity of an SAE 50 oil at high temperatures. These properties are achieved by a careful blend of additives that modulate the intermolecular interactions in the oil, thereby controlling the temperature dependence of the viscosity. Many of the commercially available oil additives “for improved engine performance” are highly viscous materials that increase the viscosity and effective SAE rating of the oil, but overusing these additives can cause the same problems experienced with highly viscous single-grade oils.</p>

                        <p class="para">Adding a soap or a surfactant to water disrupts the attractive intermolecular interactions between water molecules, thereby decreasing the surface tension. Because water is a polar molecule, one would expect that a soap or a surfactant would also disrupt the attractive interactions responsible for adhesion of water to the surface of a glass capillary. As shown in the sketch, this would decrease the height of the water column inside the capillary, as well as making the meniscus less concave.</p>

If the adhesive forces are stronger than the cohesive forces, the liquid is pulled up into the capillary and the meniscus is concave. Conversely, if the cohesive forces are stronger than the adhesive forces, the level of the liquid inside the capillary will be lower than the level outside the capillary, and the meniscus will be convex.</p>

                        <p class="para">The plots of surface tension versus temperature for propionic acid and isopropanol have essentially the same slope, but at all temperatures the surface tension of propionic acid is about 30% greater than for isopropanol. Because surface tension is a measure of the cohesive forces in a liquid, these data suggest that the cohesive forces for propionic acid are significantly greater than for isopropanol. Both substances consist of polar molecules with similar molecular masses, and the most important intermolecular interactions are likely to be dipole–dipole interactions. Consequently, these data suggest that propionic acid is more polar than isopropanol.</p>

When a liquid is heated, its molecules obtain sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the forces holding them in the liquid and they escape into the gaseous phase. By doing so, they generate a population of molecules in the vapor phase above the liquid that produces a pressure—the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">vapor pressure</a><span class="glossdef">The pressure created over a liquid by the molecules of a liquid substance that have enough kinetic energy to escape to the vapor phase.</span></span> of the liquid. In the situation we described, enough pressure was generated to move the lid, which allowed the vapor to escape. If the vapor is contained in a sealed vessel, however, such as an unvented flask, and the vapor pressure becomes too high, the flask will explode (as many students have unfortunately discovered). In this section, we describe vapor pressure in more detail and explain how to quantitatively determine the vapor pressure of a liquid.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s04_s02_p02">If a liquid is in an <em class="emphasis">open</em> container, however, most of the molecules that escape into the vapor phase will <em class="emphasis">not</em> collide with the surface of the liquid and return to the liquid phase.

Under these conditions, the liquid will continue to evaporate until it has “disappeared.” The speed with which this occurs depends on the vapor pressure of the liquid and the temperature. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Volatile liquids</a><span class="glossdef">A liquid with a relatively high vapor pressure.</span></span> have relatively high vapor pressures and tend to evaporate readily; <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonvolatile liquids</a><span class="glossdef">A liquid with a relatively low vapor pressure.</span></span> have low vapor pressures and evaporate more slowly. Although the dividing line between volatile and nonvolatile liquids is not clear-cut, as a general guideline, we can say that substances with vapor pressures greater than that of water (<a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch11_s03#averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_t01">Table 11.4 "Surface Tension, Viscosity, Vapor Pressure (at 25°C Unless Otherwise Indicated), and Normal Boiling Points of Common Liquids"</a>) are relatively volatile, whereas those with vapor pressures less than that of water are relatively nonvolatile. Thus diethyl ether (ethyl ether), acetone, and gasoline are volatile, but mercury, ethylene glycol, and motor oil are nonvolatile.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s04_s02_p03">The equilibrium vapor pressure of a substance at a particular temperature is a characteristic of the material, like its molecular mass, melting point, and boiling point (<a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch11_s03#averill_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_t01">Table 11.4 "Surface Tension, Viscosity, Vapor Pressure (at 25°C Unless Otherwise Indicated), and Normal Boiling Points of Common Liquids"</a>). It does <em class="emphasis">not</em> depend on the amount of liquid as long as at least a tiny amount of liquid is present in equilibrium with the vapor. The equilibrium vapor pressure does, however, depend very strongly on the temperature and the intermolecular forces present, as shown for several substances in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s04_s02_f01">Figure 11.16 "The Vapor Pressures of Several Liquids as a Function of Temperature"</a>. Molecules that can hydrogen bond, such as ethylene glycol, have a much lower equilibrium vapor pressure than those that cannot, such as octane. The nonlinear increase in vapor pressure with increasing temperature is <em class="emphasis">much</em> steeper than the increase in pressure expected for an ideal gas over the corresponding temperature range. The temperature dependence is so strong because the vapor pressure depends on the fraction of molecules that have a kinetic energy greater than that needed to escape from the liquid, and this fraction increases exponentially with temperature. As a result, sealed containers of volatile liquids are potential bombs if subjected to large increases in temperature. The gas tanks on automobiles are vented, for example, so that a car won’t explode when parked in the sun. Similarly, the small cans (1–5 gallons) used to transport gasoline are required by law to have a pop-off pressure release.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_p01">As the temperature of a liquid increases, the vapor pressure of the liquid increases until it equals the external pressure, or the atmospheric pressure in the case of an open container. Bubbles of vapor begin to form throughout the liquid, and the liquid begins to boil. The temperature at which a liquid boils at exactly 1 atm pressure is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">normal boiling point</a><span class="glossdef">The temperature at which a substance boils at a pressure of 1 atm.</span></span> of the liquid. For water, the normal boiling point is exactly 100°C. The normal boiling points of the other liquids in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s04_s02_f01">Figure 11.16 "The Vapor Pressures of Several Liquids as a Function of Temperature"</a> are represented by the points at which the vapor pressure curves cross the line corresponding to a pressure of 1 atm. Although we usually cite the normal boiling point of a liquid, the <em class="emphasis">actual</em> boiling point depends on the pressure. At a pressure greater than 1 atm, water boils at a temperature greater than 100°C because the increased pressure forces vapor molecules above the surface to condense. Hence the molecules must have greater kinetic energy to escape from the surface. Conversely, at pressures less than 1 atm, water boils below 100°C.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_p02">Typical variations in atmospheric pressure at sea level are relatively small, causing only minor changes in the boiling point of water. For example, the highest recorded atmospheric pressure at sea level is 813 mmHg, recorded during a Siberian winter; the lowest sea-level pressure ever measured was 658 mmHg in a Pacific typhoon. At these pressures, the boiling point of water changes minimally, to 102°C and 96°C, respectively. At high altitudes, on the other hand, the dependence of the boiling point of water on pressure becomes significant. <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_t01">Table 11.5 "The Boiling Points of Water at Various Locations on Earth"</a> lists the boiling points of water at several locations with different altitudes. At an elevation of only 5000 ft, for example, the boiling point of water is already lower than the lowest ever recorded at sea level. The lower boiling point of water has major consequences for cooking everything from soft-boiled eggs (a “three-minute egg” may well take four or more minutes in the Rockies and even longer in the Himalayas) to cakes (cake mixes are often sold with separate high-altitude instructions). Conversely, pressure cookers, which have a seal that allows the pressure inside them to exceed 1 atm, are used to cook food more rapidly by raising the boiling point of water and thus the temperature at which the food is being cooked.</p>

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_p13">Because the molecules of a liquid are in constant motion and possess a wide range of kinetic energies, at any moment some fraction of them has enough energy to escape from the surface of the liquid to enter the gas or vapor phase. This process, called <strong class="emphasis bold">vaporization</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">evaporation</strong>, generates a <strong class="emphasis bold">vapor pressure</strong> above the liquid. Molecules in the gas phase can collide with the liquid surface and reenter the liquid via <strong class="emphasis bold">condensation</strong>. Eventually, a <em class="emphasis">steady state</em> is reached in which the number of molecules evaporating and condensing per unit time is the same, and the system is in a state of <strong class="emphasis bold">dynamic equilibrium</strong>. Under these conditions, a liquid exhibits a characteristic <strong class="emphasis bold">equilibrium vapor pressure</strong> that depends only on the temperature. We can express the nonlinear relationship between vapor pressure and temperature as a linear relationship using the <strong class="emphasis bold">Clausius–Clapeyron equation</strong>. This equation can be used to calculate the enthalpy of vaporization of a liquid from its measured vapor pressure at two or more temperatures. <strong class="emphasis bold">Volatile liquids</strong> are liquids with high vapor pressures, which tend to evaporate readily from an open container; <strong class="emphasis bold">nonvolatile liquids</strong> have low vapor pressures. When the vapor pressure equals the external pressure, bubbles of vapor form within the liquid, and it boils. The temperature at which a substance boils at a pressure of 1 atm is its <strong class="emphasis bold">normal boiling point</strong>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s05_s01_p01">Phase changes are <em class="emphasis">always</em> accompanied by a change in the energy of a system. For example, converting a liquid, in which the molecules are close together, to a gas, in which the molecules are, on average, far apart, requires an input of energy (heat) to give the molecules enough kinetic energy to allow them to overcome the intermolecular attractive forces. The stronger the attractive forces, the more energy is needed to overcome them. Solids, which are highly ordered, have the strongest intermolecular interactions, whereas gases, which are very disordered, have the weakest. Thus any transition from a more ordered to a less ordered state (solid to liquid, liquid to gas, or solid to gas) requires an input of energy; it is <strong class="emphasis bold">endothermic</strong>. Conversely, any transition from a less ordered to a more ordered state (liquid to solid, gas to liquid, or gas to solid) releases energy; it is <strong class="emphasis bold">exothermic</strong>. The energy change associated with each common phase change is shown in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s05_f01">Figure 11.17 "The Three Phases of Matter and the Processes That Interconvert Them When the Temperature Is Changed"</a>.</p>

The substances with the highest melting points usually have the highest enthalpies of fusion; they tend to be ionic compounds that are held together by very strong electrostatic interactions. Substances with high boiling points are those with strong intermolecular interactions that must be overcome to convert a liquid to a gas, resulting in high enthalpies of vaporization. The enthalpy of vaporization of a given substance is much greater than its enthalpy of fusion because it takes more energy to completely separate molecules (conversion from a liquid to a gas) than to enable them only to move past one another freely (conversion from a solid to a liquid).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s05_s01_p05">Fusion, vaporization, and sublimation are endothermic processes; they occur only with the absorption of heat. Anyone who has ever stepped out of a swimming pool on a cool, breezy day has felt the heat loss that accompanies the evaporation of water from the skin. Our bodies use this same phenomenon to maintain a constant temperature: we perspire continuously, even when at rest, losing about 600 mL of water daily by evaporation from the skin. We also lose about 400 mL of water as water vapor in the air we exhale, which also contributes to cooling. Refrigerators and air-conditioners operate on a similar principle: heat is absorbed from the object or area to be cooled and used to vaporize a low-boiling-point liquid, such as ammonia or the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and the hydrofluorocarbons (HCFCs) discussed in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch03#averill_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "Chemical Reactions"</a> in connection with the ozone layer. The vapor is then transported to a different location and compressed, thus releasing and dissipating the heat. Likewise, ice cubes efficiently cool a drink not because of their low temperature but because heat is required to convert ice at 0°C to liquid water at 0°C, as demonstrated later in Example 8.</p>

Thus heat pumps that use refrigerants are essentially air-conditioners running in reverse. Heat from the environment is used to vaporize the refrigerant, which is then condensed to a liquid in coils within a house to provide heat.

Superheated liquids are not stable; the liquid will eventually boil, sometimes violently. The phenomenon of superheating causes “bumping” when a liquid is heated in the laboratory. When a test tube containing water is heated over a Bunsen burner, for example, one portion of the liquid can easily become too hot. When the superheated liquid converts to a gas, it can push or “bump” the rest of the liquid out of the test tube. Placing a stirring rod or a small piece of ceramic (a “boiling chip”) in the test tube allows bubbles of vapor to form on the surface of the object so the liquid boils instead of becoming superheated. Superheating is the reason a liquid heated in a smooth cup in a microwave oven may not boil until the cup is moved, when the motion of the cup allows bubbles to form.</p>

As heat is removed from the steam, the temperature falls until it reaches 100°C. At this temperature, the steam begins to condense to liquid water. No further temperature change occurs until all the steam is converted to the liquid; then the temperature again decreases as the water is cooled. We might expect to reach another plateau at 0°C, where the water is converted to ice; in reality, however, this does not always occur. Instead, the temperature often drops below the freezing point for some time, as shown by the little dip in the cooling curve below 0°C. This region corresponds to an unstable form of the liquid, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">supercooled liquid</a><span class="glossdef">A metastable liquid phase that exists below the normal melting point of a substance.</span></span>. If the liquid is allowed to stand, if cooling is continued, or if a small crystal of the solid phase is added (a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">seed crystal</a><span class="glossdef">A solid sample of a substance that can be added to a supercooled liquid or a supersaturated solution to help induce crystallization.</span></span>), the supercooled liquid will convert to a solid, sometimes quite suddenly. As the water freezes, the temperature increases slightly due to the heat evolved during the freezing process and then holds constant at the melting point as the rest of the water freezes. Subsequently, the temperature of the ice decreases again as more heat is removed from the system.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s05_s02_s02_p02">Supercooling effects have a huge impact on Earth’s climate. For example, supercooling of water droplets in clouds can prevent the clouds from releasing precipitation over regions that are persistently arid as a result. Clouds consist of tiny droplets of water, which in principle should be dense enough to fall as rain. In fact, however, the droplets must aggregate to reach a certain size before they can fall to the ground. Usually a small particle (a <em class="emphasis">nucleus</em>) is required for the droplets to aggregate; the nucleus can be a dust particle, an ice crystal, or a particle of silver iodide dispersed in a cloud during <em class="emphasis">seeding</em> (a method of inducing rain). Unfortunately, the small droplets of water generally remain as a supercooled liquid down to about −10°C, rather than freezing into ice crystals that are more suitable nuclei for raindrop formation. One approach to producing rainfall from an existing cloud is to cool the water droplets so that they crystallize to provide nuclei around which raindrops can grow. This is best done by dispersing small granules of solid CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> (dry ice) into the cloud from an airplane. Solid CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> sublimes directly to the gas at pressures of 1 atm or lower, and the enthalpy of sublimation is substantial (25.3 kJ/mol). As the CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> sublimes, it absorbs heat from the cloud, often with the desired results.</p>

                <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s05_s02_s02_p11">Suppose you are overtaken by a blizzard while ski touring and you take refuge in a tent. You are thirsty, but you forgot to bring liquid water. You have a choice of eating a few handfuls of snow (say 400 g) at −5.0°C immediately to quench your thirst or setting up your propane stove, melting the snow, and heating the water to body temperature before drinking it. You recall that the survival guide you leafed through at the hotel said something about not eating snow, but you can’t remember why—after all, it’s just frozen water. To understand the guide’s recommendation, calculate the amount of heat that your body will have to supply to bring 400 g of snow at −5.0°C to your body’s internal temperature of 37°C. Use the data in Example 8</p>

                <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s05_s02_s02_p13">Changes of state are examples of <strong class="emphasis bold">phase changes</strong>, or <em class="emphasis">phase transitions</em>. All phase changes are accompanied by changes in the energy of a system. Changes from a more-ordered state to a less-ordered state (such as a liquid to a gas) are <em class="emphasis">endothermic</em>. Changes from a less-ordered state to a more-ordered state (such as a liquid to a solid) are always <em class="emphasis">exothermic</em>. The conversion of a solid to a liquid is called <strong class="emphasis bold">fusion (or melting)</strong>. The energy required to melt 1 mol of a substance is its enthalpy of fusion (Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">fus</sub>). The energy change required to vaporize 1 mol of a substance is the enthalpy of vaporization (Δ<em class="emphasis">H</em><sub class="subscript">vap</sub>). The direct conversion of a solid to a gas is <strong class="emphasis bold">sublimation</strong>. The amount of energy needed to sublime 1 mol of a substance is its <strong class="emphasis bold">enthalpy of sublimation (Δ<em class="emphasis bolditalic">H</em><sub class="subscript">sub</sub>)</strong> and is the sum of the enthalpies of fusion and vaporization. Plots of the temperature of a substance versus heat added or versus heating time at a constant rate of heating are called <strong class="emphasis bold">heating curves</strong>. Heating curves relate temperature changes to phase transitions. A <strong class="emphasis bold">superheated liquid</strong>, a liquid at a temperature and pressure at which it should be a gas, is not stable. A <strong class="emphasis bold">cooling curve</strong> is not exactly the reverse of the heating curve because many liquids do not freeze at the expected temperature. Instead, they form a <strong class="emphasis bold">supercooled liquid</strong>, a metastable liquid phase that exists below the normal melting point. Supercooled liquids usually crystallize on standing, or adding a <strong class="emphasis bold">seed crystal</strong> of the same or another substance can induce crystallization.</p>

The rate at which this will occur depends solely on the partial pressure of water, not on the total pressure due to other gases.

In contrast, fusion requires much less energy, because the intermolecular interactions in a liquid and a solid are similar in magnitude in all condensed phases. Fusion requires only enough energy to overcome the intermolecular interactions that lock molecules in place in a lattice, thereby allowing them to move more freely.</p>

As we increase the temperature of a gas, liquefaction becomes more and more difficult because higher and higher pressures are required to overcome the increased kinetic energy of the molecules. In fact, for every substance, there is some temperature above which the gas can no longer be liquefied, regardless of pressure. This temperature is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">critical temperature (<em class="emphasis">T</em><sub class="subscript">c</sub>)</a><span class="glossdef">The highest temperature at which a substance can exist as a liquid, regardless of the applied pressure.</span></span>, the highest temperature at which a substance can exist as a liquid. Above the critical temperature, the molecules have too much kinetic energy for the intermolecular attractive forces to hold them together in a separate liquid phase. Instead, the substance forms a single phase that completely occupies the volume of the container. Substances with strong intermolecular forces tend to form a liquid phase over a very large temperature range and therefore have high critical temperatures. Conversely, substances with weak intermolecular interactions have relatively low critical temperatures. Each substance also has a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">critical pressure (<em class="emphasis">P</em><sub class="subscript">c</sub>)</a><span class="glossdef">The minimum pressure needed to liquefy a substance at its critical temperature.</span></span>, the minimum pressure needed to liquefy it at the critical temperature.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s06_s01_p01">To understand what happens at the critical point, consider the effects of temperature and pressure on the densities of liquids and gases, respectively. As the temperature of a liquid increases, its density decreases. As the pressure of a gas increases, its density increases. At the critical point, the liquid and gas phases have exactly the same density, and only a single phase exists. This single phase is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">supercritical fluid</a><span class="glossdef">The single, dense fluid phase that exists above the critical temperature of a substance.</span></span>, which exhibits many of the properties of a gas but has a density more typical of a liquid. For example, the density of water at its critical point (<em class="emphasis">T</em> = 374°C, <em class="emphasis">P</em> = 217.7 atm) is 0.32 g/mL, about one-third that of liquid water at room temperature but much greater than that of water vapor under most conditions. The transition between a liquid/gas mixture and a supercritical phase is demonstrated for a sample of benzene in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s06_s01_f01">Figure 11.21 "Supercritical Benzene"</a>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s06_s01_p02">In the last few years, supercritical fluids have evolved from laboratory curiosities to substances with important commercial applications. For example, carbon dioxide has a low critical temperature (31°C), a comparatively low critical pressure (73 atm), and low toxicity, making it easy to contain and relatively safe to manipulate. Because many substances are quite soluble in supercritical CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, commercial processes that use it as a solvent are now well established in the oil industry, the food industry, and others. Supercritical CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> is pumped into oil wells that are no longer producing much oil to dissolve the residual oil in the underground reservoirs. The less-viscous solution is then pumped to the surface, where the oil can be recovered by evaporation (and recycling) of the CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>. In the food, flavor, and fragrance industry, supercritical CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> is used to extract components from natural substances for use in perfumes, remove objectionable organic acids from hops prior to making beer, and selectively extract caffeine from whole coffee beans without removing important flavor components. The latter process was patented in 1974, and now virtually all decaffeinated coffee is produced this way. The earlier method used volatile organic solvents such as methylene chloride (dichloromethane [CH<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Cl<sub class="subscript">2</sub>], boiling point = 40°C), which is difficult to remove completely from the beans and is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals at high doses.</p>

By varying the cation and the anion, chemists can tailor the liquid to specific needs, such as using a solvent in a given reaction or extracting specific molecules from a solution. For example, an ionic liquid consisting of a bulky cation and anions that bind metal contaminants such as mercury and cadmium ions can remove those toxic metals from the environment. A similar approach has been applied to removing uranium and americium from water contaminated by nuclear waste.</p>

The solid and liquid phases are in equilibrium all along this line; crossing the line horizontally corresponds to melting or freezing. The line that connects points A and B is the vapor pressure curve of the liquid, which we discussed in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch11_s04#averill_1.0-ch11_s04">Section 11.4 "Vapor Pressure"</a>.

Far more reproducible than the melting point of ice, which depends on the amount of dissolved air and the atmospheric pressure, the triple point (273.16 K) is used to define the absolute (Kelvin) temperature scale. The triple point also represents the lowest pressure at which a liquid phase can exist in equilibrium with the solid or vapor. At pressures less than 0.00604 atm, therefore, ice does not melt to a liquid as the temperature increases; the solid sublimes directly to water vapor. Sublimation of water at low temperature and pressure can be used to “freeze-dry” foods and beverages. The food or beverage is first cooled to subzero temperatures and placed in a container in which the pressure is maintained below 0.00604 atm. Then, as the temperature is increased, the water sublimes, leaving the dehydrated food (such as that used by backpackers or astronauts) or the powdered beverage (as with freeze-dried coffee).</p>

Water behaves this way because it is one of the few known substances for which the crystalline solid is <em class="emphasis">less dense</em> than the liquid (others include antimony and bismuth). Increasing the pressure of ice that is in equilibrium with water at 0°C and 1 atm tends to push some of the molecules closer together, thus decreasing the volume of the sample. The decrease in volume (and corresponding increase in density) is smaller for a solid or a liquid than for a gas, but it is sufficient to melt some of the ice.</p>

As the pressure increases to 150 atm while the temperature remains the same, the line from point A crosses the ice/water boundary to point B, which lies in the liquid water region. Consequently, applying a pressure of 150 atm will melt ice at −1.0°C. We have already indicated that the pressure dependence of the melting point of water is of vital importance. If the solid/liquid boundary in the phase diagram of water were to slant up and to the right rather than to the left, ice would be denser than water, ice cubes would sink, water pipes would not burst when they freeze, and antifreeze would be unnecessary in automobile engines.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s07_s02_p09">The pressure is much lower than the pressure needed to decrease the melting point of ice by even 1°C, and experience indicates that it is possible to skate even when the temperature is well below freezing. Thus pressure-induced melting of the ice cannot explain the low friction that enables skaters (and hockey pucks) to glide. Recent research indicates that the surface of ice, where the ordered array of water molecules meets the air, consists of one or more layers of almost liquid water. These layers, together with melting induced by friction as a skater pushes forward, appear to account for both the ease with which a skater glides and the fact that skating becomes more difficult below about −7°C, when the number of lubricating surface water layers decreases.</p>

Phase diagrams contain discrete regions corresponding to the solid, liquid, and gas phases. The solid and liquid regions are separated by the melting curve of the substance, and the liquid and gas regions are separated by its vapor pressure curve, which ends at the critical point. Within a given region, only a single phase is stable, but along the lines that separate the regions, two phases are in equilibrium at a given temperature and pressure. The lines separating the three phases intersect at a single point, the <strong class="emphasis bold">triple point</strong>, which is the only combination of temperature and pressure at which all three phases can coexist in equilibrium. Water has an unusual phase diagram: its melting point decreases with increasing pressure because ice is less dense than liquid water. The phase diagram of carbon dioxide shows that liquid carbon dioxide cannot exist at atmospheric pressure. Consequently, solid carbon dioxide sublimes directly to a gas.</p>

In the phase diagrams for these liquids, there are no regions between the liquid and solid phases. Thousands of substances are known, however, that exhibit one or more phases intermediate between the liquid state, in which the molecules are free to tumble and move past one another, and the solid state, in which the molecules or ions are rigidly locked into place. In these intermediate phases, the molecules have an ordered arrangement and yet can still flow like a liquid.

The simplest such structure is the so-called smectic A phase, in which the molecules can rotate about their long axes within a given plane, but they cannot readily slide past one another. In the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cholesteric phase</a><span class="glossdef">One of three different ways that most liquid crystals can orient themselves.

As the degree of molecular ordering increases from the nematic phase to the cholesteric phase, the liquid becomes more opaque, although direct comparisons are somewhat difficult because most compounds form only one of these liquid crystal phases when the solid is melted or the liquid is cooled.</p>

Some examples of substances that form liquid crystals are listed in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s08_f03">Figure 11.27 "Structures of Typical Molecules That Form Liquid Crystals*"</a> along with their characteristic phase transition temperature ranges. In most cases, the intermolecular interactions are due to the presence of polar or polarizable groups. Aromatic rings and multiple bonds between carbon and nitrogen or oxygen are especially common.

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s08_p06">Because of their anisotropic structures, liquid crystals exhibit unusual optical and electrical properties. The intermolecular forces are rather weak and can be perturbed by an applied electric field. Because the molecules are polar, they interact with an electric field, which causes them to change their orientation slightly. Nematic liquid crystals, for example, tend to be relatively translucent, but many of them become opaque when an electric field is applied and the molecular orientation changes. This behavior is ideal for producing dark images on a light or an opalescent background, and it is used in the LCDs in digital watches; handheld calculators; flat-screen monitors; and car, ship, and aircraft instrumentation. Although each application differs in the details of its construction and operation, the basic principles are similar, as illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s08_f04">Figure 11.28 "Schematic Drawing of an LCD Device, Showing the Various Layers"</a>.</p>

Iridescent green beetles, known as jewel beetles, change color because of the light-reflecting properties of the cells that make up their external skeletons, not because of light absorption from their pigment. The cells form helices with a structure like those found in cholesteric liquid crystals. When the pitch of the helix is close to the wavelength of visible light, the cells reflect light with wavelengths that lead to brilliant metallic colors. Because a color change occurs depending on a person’s angle of view, researchers in New Zealand are studying the beetles to develop a thin material that can be used as a currency security measure. The automobile industry is also interested in exploring such materials for use in paints that would change color at different viewing angles.</p>

The products are removed at a certain distance from the starting point, when the reaction is nearly complete. The key operating parameters in a continuous-flow reactor are temperature, reactor volume, and reactant flow rate. As an industrial chemist, you think you have successfully modified a particular process to produce a higher product yield by substituting one reactant for another. The viscosity of the new reactant is, however, greater than that of the initial reactant.</p>
