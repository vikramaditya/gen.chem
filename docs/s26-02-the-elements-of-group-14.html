    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch22_s02_p01">The elements of group 14 show a greater range of chemical behavior than any other family in the periodic table. Three of the five elements—carbon, tin, and lead—have been known since ancient times. For example, some of the oldest known writings are Egyptian hieroglyphics written on papyrus with ink made from <em class="emphasis">lampblack</em>, a finely divided carbon soot produced by the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch22_s02_f01">Figure 22.5 "Very Small Particles of Noncrystalline Carbon Are Used to Make Black Ink"</a>). <em class="emphasis">Activated carbon</em> is an even more finely divided form of carbon that is produced from the thermal decomposition of organic materials, such as sawdust. Because it adsorbs many organic and sulfur-containing compounds, activated carbon is used to decolorize foods, such as sugar, and to purify gases and wastewater.</p>

        <p class="para">(a) Since ancient times, ink sticks have been the major source of black ink in Asia. Plant oils or resinous woods such as pine are burned, and the resulting soot (lampblack) is collected, mixed with binders such as animal glues and minerals, compressed into a solid stick, and allowed to dry. Liquid ink is made by rubbing the ink stick against the surface of a special stone ink dish with small amounts of water. (b) A 19th-century Japanese painting illustrates how ink is made from an ink stick.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch22_s02_p02">Tin and lead oxides and sulfides are easily reduced to the metal by heating with charcoal, a discovery that must have occurred by accident when prehistoric humans used rocks containing their ores for a cooking fire. However, because tin and copper ores are often found together in nature, their alloy—<em class="emphasis">bronze</em>—was probably discovered before either element, a discovery that led to the Bronze Age. The heaviest element in group 14, lead, is such a soft and malleable metal that the ancient Romans used thin lead foils as writing tablets, as well as lead cookware and lead pipes for plumbing. (Recall that the atomic symbols for tin and lead come from their Latin names: Sn for <em class="emphasis">stannum</em> and Pb for <em class="emphasis">plumbum</em>.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch22_s02_p03">Although the first glasses were prepared from silica (silicon oxide, SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>) around 1500 BC, elemental silicon was not prepared until 1824 because of its high affinity for oxygen. Jöns Jakob Berzelius was finally able to obtain amorphous silicon by reducing Na<sub class="subscript">2</sub>SiF<sub class="subscript">6</sub> with molten potassium. The crystalline element, which has a shiny blue-gray luster, was not isolated until 30 yr later. The last member of the group 14 elements to be discovered was germanium, which was found in 1886 in a newly discovered silver-colored ore by the German chemist Clemens Winkler, who named the element in honor of his native country.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch22_s02_s01_p01">The natural abundance of the group 14 elements varies tremendously. Elemental carbon, for example, ranks only 17th on the list of constituents of Earth’s crust. Pure graphite is obtained by reacting coke, an amorphous form of carbon used as a reductant in the production of steel, with silica to give silicon carbide (SiC). This is then thermally decomposed at very high temperatures (2700°C) to give graphite:</p>

        <p class="para block" id="averill_1.0-ch22_s02_s01_p02">One allotrope of carbon, diamond, is metastable under normal conditions, with a <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="averill-22_m030" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mi>Δ</mi><msubsup><mi>G</mi><mtext>f</mtext><mo>∘</mo></msubsup></mrow></semantics></math></span> of 2.9 kJ/mol versus graphite. At pressures greater than 50,000 atm, however, the diamond structure is favored and is the most stable form of carbon. Because the structure of diamond is more compact than that of graphite, its density is significantly higher (3.51 g/cm<sup class="superscript">3</sup> versus 2.2 g/cm<sup class="superscript">3</sup>). Because of its high thermal conductivity, diamond powder is used to transfer heat in electronic devices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch22_s02_s01_p03">The most common sources of diamonds on Earth are ancient volcanic pipes that contain a rock called <em class="emphasis">kimberlite</em>, a lava that solidified rapidly from deep inside the Earth. Most kimberlite formations, however, are much newer than the diamonds they contain. In fact, the relative amounts of different carbon isotopes in diamond show that diamond is a chemical and geological “fossil” older than our solar system, which means that diamonds on Earth predate the existence of our sun. Thus diamonds were most likely created deep inside Earth from primordial grains of graphite present when Earth was formed (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch22_s02_s01_f01">Figure 22.6 "Crystalline Samples of Carbon and Silicon, the Lightest Group 14 Elements"</a>).

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch22_s02_s01_p05">Several million tons of silicon are annually produced with this method. Amorphous silicon containing residual amounts of hydrogen is used in photovoltaic devices that convert light to electricity, and silicon-based solar cells are used to power pocket calculators, boats, and highway signs, where access to electricity by conventional methods is difficult or expensive. Ultrapure silicon and germanium form the basis of the modern electronics industry (part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch22_s02_s01_f01">Figure 22.6 "Crystalline Samples of Carbon and Silicon, the Lightest Group 14 Elements"</a>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch22_s02_s01_p06">In contrast to silicon, the concentrations of germanium and tin in Earth’s crust are only 1–2 ppm. The concentration of lead, which is the end product of the nuclear decay of many radionuclides, is 13 ppm, making lead by far the most abundant of the heavy group 14 elements. (For more information on radionuclides, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch20#averill_1.0-ch20">Chapter 20 "Nuclear Chemistry"</a>.) No concentrated ores of germanium are known; like indium, germanium is generally recovered from flue dusts obtained by processing the ores of metals such as zinc. Because germanium is essentially transparent to infrared radiation, it is used in optical devices.</p>

A “tin can,” for example, is actually a steel can whose interior is coated with a thin layer (1–2 µm) of metallic tin. Tin is also used in superconducting magnets and low-melting-point alloys such as solder and pewter.

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch22_s02_s01_p12">Recall that many carbon compounds contain multiple bonds formed by π overlap of singly occupied 2<em class="emphasis">p</em> orbitals on adjacent atoms. (For more information on atomic orbitals, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch09#averill_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Molecular Geometry and Covalent Bonding Models"</a>.) Compounds of silicon, germanium, tin, and lead with the same stoichiometry as those of carbon, however, tend to have different structures and properties. For example, CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> is a gas that contains discrete O=C=O molecules, whereas the most common form of SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> is the high-melting solid known as quartz, the major component of sand. Instead of discrete SiO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> molecules, quartz contains a three-dimensional network of silicon atoms that is similar to the structure of diamond but with an oxygen atom inserted between each pair of silicon atoms. Thus each silicon atom is linked to four other silicon atoms by bridging oxygen atoms. (For more information on the properties of solids, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12#averill_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Solids"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch12_s01#averill_1.0-ch12_s01">Section 12.1 "Crystalline and Amorphous Solids"</a>.) The tendency to catenate—to form chains of like atoms—decreases rapidly as we go down group 14 because bond energies for both the E–E and E–H bonds decrease with increasing atomic number (where E is any group 14 element). Consequently, inserting a CH<sub class="subscript">2</sub> group into a linear hydrocarbon such as <em class="emphasis">n</em>-hexane is exergonic (Δ<em class="emphasis">G</em>° = −45 kJ/mol), whereas inserting an SiH<sub class="subscript">2</sub> group into the silicon analogue of <em class="emphasis">n</em>-hexane (Si<sub class="subscript">6</sub>H<sub class="subscript">14</sub>) actually costs energy (Δ<em class="emphasis">G</em>° ≈ +25 kJ/mol). As a result of this trend, the thermal stability of catenated compounds decreases rapidly from carbon to lead.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch22_s02_s01_p13">In <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch22_s02_s01_t01">Table 22.2 "Selected Properties of the Group 14 Elements"</a> we see, once again, that there is a large difference between the lightest element (C) and the others in size, ionization energy, and electronegativity. As in group 13, the second and third elements (Si and Ge) are similar, and there is a reversal in the trends for some properties, such as ionization energy, between the fourth and fifth elements (Sn and Pb). As for group 13, these effects can be explained by the presence of filled (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 1)<em class="emphasis">d</em> and (<em class="emphasis">n</em> − 2)<em class="emphasis">f</em> subshells, whose electrons are relatively poor at screening the outermost electrons from the higher nuclear charge.</p>

Although it was originally believed that fullerenes were a new form of carbon that could be prepared only in the laboratory, fullerenes have been found in certain types of meteorites. Another possible allotrope of carbon has also been detected in impact fragments of a carbon-rich meteorite; it appears to consist of long chains of carbon atoms linked by alternating single and triple bonds, (–C≡C–C≡C–)<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub>.

                <li>Because the carbon in CO is in an intermediate oxidation state (+2), CO can be either a reductant or an oxidant; it is also a Lewis base. The other reactant (Cl<sub class="subscript">2</sub>) is an oxidant, so we expect a redox reaction to occur in which the carbon of CO is further oxidized. Because Cl<sub class="subscript">2</sub> is a two-electron oxidant and the carbon atom of CO can be oxidized by two electrons to the +4 oxidation state, the product is phosgene (Cl<sub class="subscript">2</sub>C=O).</li>
                <li>Unlike Cl<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, BF<sub class="subscript">3</sub> is not a good oxidant, even though it contains boron in its highest oxidation state (+3). Nor can BF<sub class="subscript">3</sub> behave like a reductant. Like any other species with only six valence electrons, however, it is certainly a Lewis acid. Hence an acid–base reaction is the most likely alternative, especially because we know that CO can use the lone pair of electrons on carbon to act as a Lewis base. The most probable reaction is therefore the formation of a Lewis acid–base adduct.</li>
                <li>Typically, both reactants behave like reductants. Unless one of them can also behave like an oxidant, no reaction will occur. We know that Sr is an active metal because it lies far to the left in the periodic table and that it is more electropositive than carbon. Carbon is a nonmetal with a significantly higher electronegativity; it is therefore more likely to accept electrons in a redox reaction. We conclude, therefore, that Sr will be oxidized, and C will be reduced. Carbon forms ionic carbides with active metals, so the reaction will produce a species formally containing either C<sup class="superscript">4−</sup> or C<sub class="subscript">2</sub><sup class="superscript">2−</sup>.

Silicon and germanium are both semiconductors with structures analogous to diamond. Tin has two common allotropes: white (β) tin has a metallic lattice and metallic properties, whereas gray (α) tin has a diamond-like structure and is a semiconductor. The metallic β form is stable above 13.2°C, and the nonmetallic α form is stable below 13.2°C.

In fact, it dissolves in strong aqueous base to produce hydrogen gas and solutions of silicates, but the only aqueous acid that it reacts with is hydrofluoric acid, presumably due to the formation of the stable SiF<sub class="subscript">6</sub><sup class="superscript">2−</sup> ion. Germanium is more metallic in its behavior than silicon. For example, it dissolves in hot oxidizing acids, such as HNO<sub class="subscript">3</sub> and H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>SO<sub class="subscript">4</sub>, but in the absence of an oxidant, it does not dissolve in aqueous base. Although tin has an even more metallic character than germanium, lead is the only element in the group that behaves purely as a metal. Acids do not readily attack it because the solid acquires a thin protective outer layer of a Pb<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> salt, such as PbSO<sub class="subscript">4</sub>.</p>

The relative strengths of the C–O and Si–O bonds contradict the generalization that bond strengths decrease as the bonded atoms become larger. This is because we have thus far assumed that a formal single bond between two atoms can always be described in terms of a single pair of shared electrons. In the case of Si–O bonds, however, the presence of relatively low-energy, empty <em class="emphasis">d</em> orbitals on Si and nonbonding electron pairs in the <em class="emphasis">p</em> or <em class="emphasis">sp</em><sup class="superscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sup> hybrid orbitals of O results in a partial π bond (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch22_s02_s03_f01">Figure 22.7 "Pi Bonding between Silicon and Oxygen"</a>). Due to its partial π double bond character, the Si–O bond is significantly stronger and shorter than would otherwise be expected. A similar interaction with oxygen is also an important feature of the chemistry of the elements that follow silicon in the third period (P, S, and Cl). Because the Si–O bond is unusually strong, silicon–oxygen compounds dominate the chemistry of silicon.</p>

                <li>Lead is a metal, and chlorine is a nonmetal that is a strong oxidant. Thus we can expect a redox reaction to occur in which the metal acts as a reductant. Although lead can form compounds in the +2 and +4 oxidation states, Pb<sup class="superscript">4+</sup> is a potent oxidant (the inert-pair effect). Because lead prefers the +2 oxidation state and chlorine is a weaker oxidant than fluorine, we expect PbCl<sub class="subscript">2</sub> to be the product.</li>
                <li>This is the reaction of water with a metal silicide, which formally contains the Si<sup class="superscript">4−</sup> ion. Water can act as either an acid or a base. Because the other compound is a base, we expect an acid–base reaction to occur in which water acts as an acid. Because Mg<sub class="subscript">2</sub>Si contains Si in its lowest possible oxidation state, however, an oxidation–reduction reaction is also a possibility. But water is a relatively weak oxidant, so an acid–base reaction is more likely. The acid (H<sub class="subscript">2</sub>O) transfers a proton to the base (Si<sup class="superscript">4−</sup>), which can accept four protons to form SiH<sub class="subscript">4</sub>. Proton transfer from water produces the OH<sup class="superscript">−</sup> ion, which will combine with Mg<sup class="superscript">2+</sup> to give magnesium hydroxide.</li>
                <li>We expect germanium dioxide (GeO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>) to be amphoteric because of the position of germanium in the periodic table. It should dissolve in strong aqueous base to give an anionic species analogous to silicate.</li>

            <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch22_s02_s03_p29">The group 14 elements show the greatest range of chemical behavior of any group in the periodic table. Because the covalent bond strength decreases with increasing atomic size and greater-than-expected ionization energies due to an increase in <em class="emphasis">Z</em><sub class="subscript">eff</sub>, the stability of the +2 oxidation state increases from carbon to lead. The tendency to form multiple bonds and to catenate decreases as the atomic number increases. The stability of the carbon tetrahalides decreases as the halogen increases in size because of poor orbital overlap and steric crowding. Carbon forms three kinds of carbides with less electronegative elements: ionic carbides, which contain metal cations and C<sup class="superscript">4−</sup> (methide) or C<sub class="subscript">2</sub><sup class="superscript">2−</sup> (acetylide) anions; interstitial carbides, which are characterized by covalent metal–carbon interactions and are among the hardest substances known; and covalent carbides, which have three-dimensional covalent network structures that make them extremely hard, high melting, and chemically inert. Consistent with periodic trends, metallic behavior increases down the group. Silicon has a tremendous affinity for oxygen because of partial Si–O π bonding. Dioxides of the group 14 elements become increasingly basic down the group and their metallic character increases. Silicates contain anions that consist of only silicon and oxygen. Aluminosilicates are formed by replacing some of the Si atoms in silicates by Al atoms; aluminosilicates with three-dimensional framework structures are called zeolites. Nitrides formed by reacting silicon or germanium with nitrogen are strong, hard, and chemically inert. The hydrides become thermodynamically less stable down the group. Moreover, as atomic size increases, multiple bonds between or to the group 14 elements become weaker. Silicones, which contain an Si–O backbone and Si–C bonds, are high-molecular-mass polymers whose properties depend on their compositions.</p>
