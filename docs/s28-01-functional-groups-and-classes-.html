The major families of organic compounds are characterized by their functional groups. <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s01_f01">Figure 24.1 "Major Classes of Organic Compounds"</a> summarizes five families introduced in earlier chapters, gives examples of compounds that contain each functional group, and lists the suffix or prefix used in the systematic nomenclature of compounds that contain each functional group.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s01_p02">The first family listed in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s01_f01">Figure 24.1 "Major Classes of Organic Compounds"</a> is the hydrocarbons. These include alkanes, with the general molecular formula C<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub>H<sub class="subscript">2</sub><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub><sub class="subscript">+2</sub> where <em class="emphasis">n</em> is an integer; alkenes, represented by C<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub>H<sub class="subscript">2</sub><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub>; alkynes, represented by C<sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub>H<sub class="subscript">2</sub><sub class="subscript"><em class="emphasis">n</em></sub><sub class="subscript">−2</sub>; and arenes. Halogen-substituted alkanes, alkenes, and arenes form a second major family of organic compounds, which include the alkyl halides and the aryl halides. Oxygen-containing organic compounds, a third family, may be divided into two main types: those that contain at least one C–O bond, which include alcohols, phenols (derivatives of benzene), and ethers, and those that contain a carbonyl group (C=O), which include aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acid derivatives, the fourth family listed, are compounds in which the OH of the –CO<sub class="subscript">2</sub>H functional group is replaced by either an alkoxy (–OR) group, producing an ester, or by an amido (–NRR′, where R and R′ can be H and/or alkyl groups), forming an amide. Nitrogen-containing organic compounds, the fifth family, include amines; nitriles, which have a C≡N bond; and nitro compounds, which contain the –NO<sub class="subscript">2</sub> group.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s01_p03">As you learned in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch02#averill_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Molecules, Ions, and Chemical Formulas"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch02_s04#averill_1.0-ch02_s04">Section 2.4 "Naming Covalent Compounds"</a>, the systematic nomenclature of organic compounds indicates the positions of substituents using the lowest numbers possible to identify their locations in the carbon chain of the parent compound. If two compounds have the same systematic name, then they are the same compound. Although systematic names are preferred because they are unambiguous, many organic compounds are known by their common names rather than their systematic names. Common nomenclature uses the prefix <em class="emphasis">form</em>—for a compound that contains no carbons other than those in the functional group, and <em class="emphasis">acet</em>—for those that have one carbon atom in addition [two in the case of acetone, (CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub>)<sub class="subscript">2</sub>C=O]. Thus methanal and ethanal, respectively, are the systematic names for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s01_p04">Recall that in the systematic nomenclature of aromatic compounds, the positions of groups attached to the aromatic ring are indicated by numbers, starting with 1 and proceeding around the ring in the direction that produces the lowest possible numbers. For example, the position of the first CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub> group in dimethyl benzene is indicated with a 1, but the second CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub> group, which can be placed in any one of three positions, produces 1,2-dimethylbenzene, 1,3-dimethylbenzene, or 1,4-dimethylbenzene (<a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch24_s01_f02">Figure 24.2 "Common Nomenclature for Aromatic Ring Substitutions"</a>). In common nomenclature, in contrast, the prefixes <em class="emphasis">ortho</em>-, <em class="emphasis">meta</em>-, and <em class="emphasis">para</em>- are used to describe the relative positions of groups attached to an aromatic ring. If the CH<sub class="subscript">3</sub> groups in dimethylbenzene, whose common name is xylene, are adjacent to each other, the compound is commonly called <em class="emphasis">ortho</em>-xylene, abbreviated <em class="emphasis">o</em>-xylene. If they are across from each other on the ring, the compound is commonly called <em class="emphasis">para</em>-xylene or <em class="emphasis">p</em>-xylene. When the arrangement is intermediate between those of <em class="emphasis">ortho</em>- and <em class="emphasis">para</em>- compounds, the name is <em class="emphasis">meta</em>-xylene or <em class="emphasis">m</em>-xylene.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="averill_1.0-ch24_s01_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Functional groups</strong> are structural units that determine the chemical reactivity of a molecule under a given set of conditions. Organic compounds are classified into several major categories based on the functional groups they contain. In the systematic names of organic compounds, numbers indicate the positions of functional groups in the basic hydrocarbon framework. Many organic compounds also have common names, which use the prefix <em class="emphasis">form</em>—for a compound that contains no carbons other than those in the functional group and <em class="emphasis">acet</em>—for those that have one additional carbon atom.</p>
