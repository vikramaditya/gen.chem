    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s03_p01">The structures of most binary compounds can be described using the packing schemes we have just discussed for metals. To do so, we generally focus on the arrangement in space of the largest species present. In ionic solids, this generally means the anions, which are usually arranged in a simple cubic, bcc, fcc, or hcp lattice. (For more information about anions, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch07#averill_1.0-ch07">Chapter 7 "The Periodic Table and Periodic Trends"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch07_s02#averill_1.0-ch07_s02">Section 7.2 "Sizes of Atoms and Ions"</a>.) Often, however, the anion lattices are not truly “close packed”; because the cations are large enough to prop them apart somewhat, the anions are not actually in contact with one another. In ionic compounds, the cations usually occupy the “holes” between the anions, thus balancing the negative charge. The ratio of cations to anions within a unit cell is required to achieve electrical neutrality and corresponds to the bulk stoichiometry of the compound.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p01">As you learned in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch06#averill_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "The Structure of Atoms"</a>, the wavelengths of x-rays are approximately the same magnitude as the distances between atoms in molecules or ions. Consequently, x-rays are a useful tool for obtaining information about the structures of crystalline substances. In a technique called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">x-ray diffraction</a><span class="glossdef">An technique used to obtain information about the structures of crystalline substances by using x-rays.</span></span>, a beam of x-rays is aimed at a sample of a crystalline material, and the x-rays are diffracted by layers of atoms in the crystalline lattice (part (a) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_f01">Figure 12.13 "X-Ray Diffraction"</a>). When the beam strikes photographic film, it produces an x-ray diffraction pattern, which consists of dark spots on a light background (part (b) in <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_f01">Figure 12.13 "X-Ray Diffraction"</a>). In 1912, the German physicist Max von Laue (1879–1960; Nobel Prize in Physics, 1914) predicted that x-rays should be diffracted by crystals, and his prediction was rapidly confirmed. Within a year, two British physicists, William Henry Bragg (1862–1942) and his son, William Lawrence Bragg (1890–1972), had worked out the mathematics that allows x-ray diffraction to be used to measure interatomic distances in crystals. The Braggs shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1915, when the son was only 25 years old. Virtually everything we know today about the detailed structures of solids and molecules in solids is due to the x-ray diffraction technique.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p02">Recall from <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch06#averill_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "The Structure of Atoms"</a> that two waves that are in phase interfere constructively, thus reinforcing each other and generating a wave with a greater amplitude. In contrast, two waves that are out of phase interfere destructively, effectively canceling each other. When x-rays interact with the components of a crystalline lattice, they are scattered by the electron clouds associated with each atom.
