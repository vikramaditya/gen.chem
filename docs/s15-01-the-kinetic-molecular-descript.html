    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objective</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_l01">
            <li>To be familiar with the kinetic molecular description of liquids.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_p01">The kinetic molecular theory of gases described in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch10#averill_1.0-ch10">Chapter 10 "Gases"</a> gives a reasonably accurate description of the behavior of gases. A similar model can be applied to liquids, but it must take into account the nonzero volumes of particles and the presence of strong intermolecular attractive forces.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_p02">In a gas, the distance between molecules, whether monatomic or polyatomic, is very large compared with the size of the molecules; thus gases have a low density and are highly compressible. In contrast, the molecules in liquids are very close together, with essentially no empty space between them. As in gases, however, the molecules in liquids are in constant motion, and their kinetic energy (and hence their speed) depends on their temperature. We begin our discussion by examining some of the characteristic properties of liquids to see how each is consistent with a modified kinetic molecular description.</p>
    <div class="section" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Density</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p01">The molecules of a liquid are packed relatively close together. Consequently, liquids are much denser than gases. The density of a liquid is typically about the same as the density of the solid state of the substance. Densities of liquids are therefore more commonly measured in units of grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm<sup class="superscript">3</sup>) or grams per milliliter (g/mL) than in grams per liter (g/L), the unit commonly used for gases.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Molecular Order</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_p01">Liquids exhibit short-range order because strong intermolecular attractive forces cause the molecules to pack together rather tightly. Because of their higher kinetic energy compared to the molecules in a solid, however, the molecules in a liquid move rapidly with respect to one another. Thus unlike the ions in the ionic solids discussed in <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch08#averill_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Ionic versus Covalent Bonding"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch08_s02#averill_1.0-ch08_s02">Section 8.2 "Ionic Bonding"</a>, the molecules in liquids are not arranged in a repeating three-dimensional array. Unlike the molecules in gases, however, the arrangement of the molecules in a liquid is not completely random.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Compressibility</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_p01">Liquids have so little empty space between their component molecules that they cannot be readily compressed. Compression would force the atoms on adjacent molecules to occupy the same region of space.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Thermal Expansion</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s04_p01">The intermolecular forces in liquids are strong enough to keep them from expanding significantly when heated (typically only a few percent over a 100°C temperature range). Thus the volumes of liquids are somewhat fixed. Notice from <a class="xref" href="#averill_1.0-ch11_s01_s04_t01">Table 11.1 "The Density of Water at Various Temperatures"</a> that the density of water, for example, changes by only about 3% over a 90-degree temperature range.</p>
