We also introduced two idealized types of bonding: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">covalent bonding</a><span class="glossdef">A type of chemical bonding in which electrons are shared between atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion.</span></span>, in which electrons are shared between atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ionic bonding</a><span class="glossdef">A type of chemical bonding in which positively and negatively charged ions are held together by electrostatic forces.</span></span>, in which positively and negatively charged ions are held together by electrostatic forces. The concepts of covalent and ionic bonding were developed to explain the properties of different kinds of chemical substances. Ionic compounds, for example, typically dissolve in water to form aqueous solutions that conduct electricity. (For more information about solution conductivity, see <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch04#averill_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "Reactions in Aqueous Solution"</a>, <a class="xref" href="averill_1.0-ch04_s01#averill_1.0-ch04_s01">Section 4.1 "Aqueous Solutions"</a>.) In contrast, most covalent compounds that dissolve in water form solutions that do not conduct electricity. Furthermore, many covalent compounds are volatile, whereas ionic compounds are not.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="averill_1.0-ch08_s01_p02">Despite the differences in the distribution of electrons between these two idealized types of bonding, all models of chemical bonding have three features in common:</p>

        <li>Atoms interact with one another to form aggregates such as molecules, compounds, and crystals because doing so lowers the total energy of the system; that is, the aggregates are more stable than the isolated atoms.</li>
        <li>Energy is required to dissociate bonded atoms or ions into isolated atoms or ions. For ionic solids, in which the ions form a three-dimensional array called a <em class="emphasis">lattice</em>, this energy is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">lattice energy(<em class="emphasis">U</em>)</a><span class="glossdef">The enthalpy change that occurs when a solid ionic compound (whose ions form a three-dimensional array called a lattice) is transformed into gaseous ions.</span></span>, the enthalpy change that occurs when a solid ionic compound is transformed into gaseous ions.

All models of chemical bonding have three common features: atoms form bonds because the products are more stable than the isolated atoms; bonding interactions are characterized by a particular energy (the <strong class="emphasis bold">bond energy</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">lattice energy</strong>), which is the amount of energy required to dissociate the substance into its components; and bonding interactions have an optimal internuclear distance, the <strong class="emphasis bold">bond distance</strong>.</p>
